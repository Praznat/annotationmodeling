<seg id="1">Avoid Dieting to Avoid Flu</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">This research of American scientists has come to light after experiments done on mice.</seg>
<seg id="3">The experiments have proved that the capability of fighting Flu virus became less in mice placed on food containing fewer calories.</seg>
<seg id="4">The old saying that,'It's better to starve during fever,'has been proven wrong by the research.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the scientists,eat well during fever.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the researchers of Michigan State University, the fighting capability against infections in mice that were placed on a diet was found meagre and the chances of their death increased, while the mice placed on regular food had a very high immunity against flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Professor Elizabeth Gardner, people on a diet will not only be affected very quickly by the flu,it will also take more time for them to recuperate.</seg>
<seg id="8">She also says that even those people who have taken the flu vaccine should avoid dieting during the few months of winter.</seg>

<seg id="1">"First Nuclear Experiment conducted in 1990"</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Thomas Reed, who has worked as a weapon designer in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory of America, has written this book in collaboration with Danny Stillman,the former Director of Technical Intelligence of Los Alamos National Laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="3">This book has been written with the title 'Nuclear Express:A Political History of the Bomb And its Proliferation,' and in this both the authors have claimed that any country that has made an atomic bomb has either stolen the nuclear secrets of another country or has had cooperation with some other nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thomas Reed said in an interview to US News that in 1990, in the era of Benazir Bhutto, China had conducted the experiment of Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas Reed said that he is convinced on the basis of several reasons that China has conducted the experiment of Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those reasons include the design of the bomb and information obtained while talking to the scientists of China.</seg>
<seg id="7">He further said that this was the reason why in 1998, Pakistan was able to conduct a nuclear experiment just in two weeks and three days in response to India's nuclear experiment.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thomas Reed also reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and it took 17 days for America to do the experiment in response to this, although America already had this bomb for awhile.</seg>
<seg id="9">He further said that the atom bomb, whose experiment was done in 1998 by Pakistan, was developed with extreme care and Pakistani scientists had full confidence in it.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Thomas Reed was asked if China had provided the nuclear technology to Pakistan, he replied that India was a common enemy of China and Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that the proof to this also exists in that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and, apart from this, the documents retrieved from Libya afterwards also proved this.</seg>
<seg id="12">To another question as to whether it is usual to carry out nuclear experiments with others, he said that in 1990 America openly conducted a nuclear experiment for Britain in the desert of Nevada.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said that we may also presume that Israel, too, was given access to the results of this experiment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thomas Reed was also asked whether China's nuclear proliferation program is active.</seg>
<seg id="15">On this, Thomas Reid said that since 1991, China has been providing raw material, instructions, and designs for the nuclear structure situated in Ispahan, a city in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="16">Besides this, China has also provided an enrichment plant to Iran in Karaj.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen through North Korea.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Tuesday in front of Islamabad Press Club, journalists and newspaper workers rallied and raised slogans in a protest organized by the organization of the journalists of Islamabad 'RIUJ' against media owners and the government on the sacking of a large number of employees from TV channels and newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Addressing the demonstrators, the senior member of the largest organization of the journalists, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, C. R. Shamsi, said that those politicians who were protesting with us on the streets lately, have now become rulers and are sitting in the parliament; however, they are not doing any good for the rights of journalists, as they are afraid of a specific group of newspaper owners.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said that the newspaper owners, who talk about human rights, have turned their organizations into torture cells and labor camps, where, despite making billions of rupees, they are committing financial murder on workers by paying them extremely low wages and sacking them from the employment.</seg>
<seg id="5">In front of us, the example of this is that of a worker of a private TV channel FIVE who committed suicide after not getting the salary for four months, and even today, many workers are living miserably because of forced dismissals and not getting salaries for months.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that direct action should be taken against TV and newspaper owners, and for the rights of journalists, a protest camp is needed on a permanent basis in front of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="7">Criticizing the Governor of the Punjab Salman Taseer, C. R. Shamsi said that the employees are being sacked without any notice from his Urdu newspaper 'Aaj Kal',</seg>

<seg id="1">European Union's Role in Middle East Peace</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">If seen from the official perspective, the European Union's role in reconciliation efforts to stop the Middle East war is decisive.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the Brussels government stand, efforts of the Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy's are synonymous to help in this task.</seg>
<seg id="4">The spokesman of the European Commission Amadeu Altafaj said that all such efforts through which sending a joint message to the warring parties from the European Union could be helpful, are worthy of praise.</seg>
<seg id="5">Everything looks fine from the perspective of the official statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, in reality, the European Union is presenting a regretful picture of the internal tug of war.</seg>
<seg id="7">The role of the Czech Republic as the President of the Union is already weak.</seg>
<seg id="8">On top of this, the internal wrangling has made it helpless.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the other hand, the French President Sarkozy is acting like he is still discharging the duties as the president of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although France has already completed its six-month presidential tenure.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sarkozy wants to play the lead role and he can do it; but he is not permitted for this.</seg>
<seg id="12">The most embarrassing situation is being faced by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner.</seg>
<seg id="13">He is in the delegation which is headed by the Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic, Schwarzenberg.</seg>
<seg id="14">And on top of this, both foreign ministers are giving different statements about the Middle East war.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kouchner says that Israel has a right of self-defense, while according to Schwarzenberg, this war does not come under self defense. In the meantime, Germany has also sent its special envoy to the Middle East. Until the European Union shows harmony based on similar point of views, it cannot succeed on the diplomatic front.</seg>
<seg id="16">The proof of this is the attitude of Israel, which does not give any importance to the reconciliation efforts of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is the golden opportunity for the European Union to accomplish something, as America has already failed in the Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush.</seg>

</hl>
<seg id="2">Although Adolf Merckle, a resident of the area of Swabia of South Germany, has left a huge business group after him.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the common German citizens did not know much about him up until a little while ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">Then, when he had to negotiate with about 30 banks for many weeks which provided loans to his business group, he became the subject of the headlines, and the future of Merckle Group also looked to bleak him.</seg>
<seg id="5">Merckle Group also had to bear a loss of hundreds of millions of Euros due to the financial crisis after buying shares of German car manufacturing company Volkswagen.</seg>
<seg id="6">And when the financial institutions denied the new loans, valued at between 700 million and one-billion Euros, mandatorily needed by this group, Merckle came under severe stress.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sometime back, these very banks had agreed to provide loans to Merckle Group on an emergency basis; however, Adolf Merckle, who had risen to such heights from a small industrialist that his group's income had become around 30 billion Euros, could not bear the loss of his investment power.</seg>
<seg id="8">When Adolf Merckle took charge of his family business after the death of his father, he managed it on the modern lines and gave it a tremendous boost.</seg>
<seg id="9">He named his company Ratiopharm, which is an extremely successful and very large pharmaceutical firm of Germany today.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until sometime ago, the business worth of this pharmaceutical firm was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and even now it earns 1.8 billion Euros annually. After the huge success of Ratiopharm, Merckle Group purchased many large firms, which included a company named Heidelberg Cement manufacturing construction materials to the company named Kaessbohrer, which manufactures a special type of vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="11">The number of the employees of Merckle Group around the globe is one-hundred thousand and in its assets, Ratiopharm, the drug manufacturing company, has always held special importance.</seg>
<seg id="12">Adolf Merckle had said this many times in his life: "We have been manufacturing drugs for four generations.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now the management of this firm is in the hands of my children and I hope that this firm will still remain under my family's management for a few hundred years.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the suicide of Adolf Merckle, banks have approved interim loans worth 400 million Euros for his group VEM, but on the condition that VEM has to sell Ratiopharm so that the financial condition of this group could be improved on a long-term basis.</seg>
<seg id="15">This way, after the death of Adolf Merckle, the Merckle Group would not remain the same like it used to be.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the latest statistics, the crime rate among foreigners between 2004 and 2007</seg>
<seg id="3">has reduced from 22.9 percent</seg>
<seg id="4">to 21.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Joachim Herrmann, the Interior Minister of Bavaria Province, this is apparently a mere positive change.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said: "It should be kept in mind that the number of foreigners seeking German nationality is increasing."</seg>
<seg id="7">Therefore, this fact should also be mentioned in the statistics that although the person who commits a crime is a German, he/she also has a foreign background.</seg>
<seg id="8">Herrmann said that from 2010, his province will keep this fact in mind while collecting statistics about criminals.</seg>
<seg id="9">Besides Bavaria, the province of Hamburg is also thinking on the same lines.</seg>
<seg id="10">Senator for Interior Affairs Christoph Ahlhaus of CDU said: "When investigations are done according to the scientific method, a person cannot compile results beforehand as per his/her own will, instead the results depend on the statistics which come after the investigations have been completed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Ahlhaus drew attention to an analytical report of a provincial crime control office, which was prepared in 2006, and according to which it was investigated that in Bergdorf, a part of the city of Hamburg, what percentage of the foreigners is involved in the crimes taking place there.</seg>
<seg id="12">The results have shown that here foreigners'</seg>
<seg id="13">rate of crime is lower as compared to the crimes taking place in the whole province.</seg>
<seg id="14">Contrary to this, when in Berlin, in 2006 the rate of crime in youngsters was reviewed, it was found that the percentage of youngsters having foreign background was 44</seg>
<seg id="15">.7 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the other political parties of Germany, for example Linkspartei, the party of environmentalists, Greens and the leftist party, SPD, are against this proposal that, while collecting statistics related to crimes, this information should also be collected in which German citizens have a foreign background.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new American President Barack Hussein Obama has started acting superficially on the promises made during his election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this connection he has issued instructions for making a plan for the return of American troops from Iraq; whereas, today, the American President will sign the order to close the ignominious prison of Guantanamo Bay.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is expected that today President Barack Obama is possibly going to sign the order according to which Guantanamo Bay prison will be closed within a year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Besides this, orders for the review of the investigative methods on suspected terrorists and the ban on the use of foul language with the prisoners are also expected to be issued from the White House.</seg>
<seg id="7">President Barack Obama started working on fulfilling the election promises on the first day of his presidency and has taken steps for making the actions and working of his government transparent as the priority.</seg>
<seg id="8">The observers say that the American President has started making efforts to save the falling reputation of America on the international level, but it is very difficult for him to succeed in it, because as long as America is supporting the predator government of Israel, nothing good can be expected from her. If America wants to save its reputation, then it has to withdraw from supporting Israel and should not participate in her crimes.</seg>

<seg id="2">The news agency Mehr has copied with reference of the British newspaper, The Times, that the former Prime Minister of Britain has emphasized the need to include Hamas in the Middle East peace process.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the newspaper, Tony Blair said that a way should be found through which Hamas should be brought into the peace process of the Middle East. Blair also strongly criticized the Bush administration for talking only to Mahmoud Abbas and ignoring Hamas. It should remain clear that the Western countries, after assessing the public and administrative power of Hamas, are now talking about including it in the conference, whereas before this they used to call Hamas a terrorist organization; a terrorist organization which is defending its country and trying to emancipate its country from the grip of others, whose houses and country have been occupied for sixty years by a tyrannical government like that of Israel.</seg>

</hl>

<seg id="3">if taken daily, reduces the risk of breast cancer by more than one third in women aged less than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this research, done in the Moffitt Cancer Center in the state of Florida in America, it has been said that the risk of cancer of the breast tumor in the women, aged under 50,</seg>
<seg id="5">is reduced by up to 37 percent for those who drink at least three cups of tea daily.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the research, it was also said that the women of higher age don't get any noticeable benefits in this regard by taking three or more cups of tea daily.</seg>
<seg id="7">The experts say that the reason of this is the presence of some elements in the tea that are effective against those tumors which occur in the women of less than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="8">This research was done on more than five-thousand women who were treated for breast cancer in the Moffitt Cancer Center, situated in the city of Tampa in the state of Florida.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.</seg>
<seg id="10">The experts compared their medical records and their lifestyle with those of the women who were safe from breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experts also came to know that tea visibly showed its effect on a special type of cancer 'lobular' which was reduced up to 66 percent.</seg>
<seg id="12">Every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type.</seg>
<seg id="13">This type of cancer is dangerous because of the reason that it is deep-seated and usually it is diagnosed when it has already widely spread.</seg>
<seg id="14">The experts say that drinking at least three cups of tea daily on a regular basis may reduce the risk of breast cancer conspicuously in younger women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The chief of the Indian Army General Deepak Kapoor has said that there are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan; however, to defend the country, and to assure the safety of its interests, we are ready at all times for giving sacrifices.</seg>
<seg id="3">General Kapoor blamed that despite reassurances and pressure from the international community on Pakistan as a result of the Mumbai attacks, in his words, the infrastructure of terrorism is not only intact on Pakistani soil, but is also active.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said this while talking to news correspondents in Srinagar.</seg>
<seg id="5">The chief of the Indian army was on a one-day visit to the valley of Kashmir to review the collective security situation and the preparations of the army on the borders in Kashmir under the New Delhi administration.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was asked what his comments were in reference to the media reports that Pakistan has rejected the proof presented by India with reference to the Mumbai attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">General Kapoor said that the decisions on the matter pertaining to war and peace are taken by the political leadership.</seg>
<seg id="8">Talking about the alleged infrastructure of terrorism present on Pakistani soil, he said that the Indian army will face those elements who are determined to disrupt peace and to weaken India.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that seven-hundred to eight-hundred militants are present in the Indian Kashmir, out of which about fifty percent are foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="10">General Deepak Kapoor said that with better weather conditions, the effort of influx from Pakistan and Kashmir under Pakistan's administration may increase; however, India has enhanced alert on the borders.</seg>
<seg id="11">He rejected the possibility of reduction in the strength of the army deployed in the Indian-administered Kashmir by saying that the security of the country could not be compromised.</seg>

<seg id="2">Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q have submitted their draft Eighteenth Amendment bills to the National Assembly and the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="3">So far, it seems that drafts for the Eighteenth Amendment are political tricks, and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is because of the same reason that no one has so far made any hue and cry in favor of this amendment on the floor of the Assembly or the Senate and forced the houses to approve this amendment.</seg>
<seg id="5">It appears that after submitting the draft Eighteenth Amendment, these parties have created a proof of their effort, which means they are now able to tell the people tomorrow that they had submitted the amendment, but the speaker of the government party did not process it.</seg>
<seg id="6">MQM is a coalition partner of the government, Muslim league N is a hidden ally of the government, whereas Muslim League Q is a party responsible for passing the Seventeenth Amendment.

<seg id="7">This is clearly an excuse to claim a big reward for a marginal effort.</seg>

<seg id="3">To be saved from this, I wrote a letter to the editor of Daily Imroz asking him what to do after Matric so as to avoid physical labor.</seg>
<seg id="4">The editor in his reply advised to become a doctor or engineer and suggested the reading of specific subjects.</seg>
<seg id="5">From the beginning I was interested in engineering, that is why I studied technical drawing instead of biology.</seg>
<seg id="6">But at the time of admission in F.Sc., my elder brother forced me to become a doctor by doing F.Sc. in pre-medical.</seg>
<seg id="7">I barely studied biology for a month, but, being unable to understand it, opted to take up mathematics.</seg>
<seg id="8">This means that the fear of physical labor helped me to become an engineer, and now among the family members of the same age group, I am in a comparatively better position for which I am always thankful to God.</seg>
<seg id="9">This story came to my mind at a time when I, along with my two young sons, was trying to take away the carpets of our old house.</seg>

<seg id="13">All three of us finished this job by hook or by crook in three hours and returned home.</seg>

<seg id="4">In Sawat, killing of extremists is claimed as a result of shelling from gunship helicopters and artillery fires during security forces operations, but even with these killings, the Taliban have not only gathered more strength, but, according to an estimate, they are in control of 80% of the Sawat area.</seg>

<seg id="3">They will fight shoulder-to-shoulder with Pakistan if there occurred a war;</seg>
<seg id="4">when their love will be realized. Nothing would be achieved only with the politics of agitation; in my opinion, there is a possibility of a decisive war between both so that they get satisfied.</seg>

<seg id="1">'First Nuclear Test, Carried Out in 1990'</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Thomas Reed, who has worked as Weapons Designer at America's Lever National Laboratory, wrote this book in coordination with former Director of Technical Intelligence at the Alamos National Laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="3">This book has been written under the title, 'The Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation' and both the writers have claimed in it that every country that has made the atom bomb has either stolen nuclear secrets from another country or has had the cooperation of another atomic power.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thomas Reed said in an interview to the US News that in 1990 China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb during Benazir Bhutto regime.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas Reed said that he believes, based on many reasons, that China had tested Pakistan's first atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reasons include the design of that bomb and information received during conversations with Chinese scientists.</seg>
<seg id="7">He further said that this is why Pakistan was able to carry out atomic test within only two weeks and three days in response to India's atomic tests in 1998.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thomas Reed recalled that Russia had suddenly conducted an atomic test in 1961 and in response to it, it took America seventeen days to conduct a test in spite of the fact that America had that bomb for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="9">He further said that the atom bomb tested by Pakistan in May, 1998, had been made very carefully and Pakistani scientists had full confidence in it.</seg>
<seg id="10">When asked, why China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, Thomas Reed replied, it was because India was the common enemy of China and Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that there was also evidence that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan had in fact used Chinese design, and in addition, the documents that were later acquired from Libya confirm this.</seg>
<seg id="12">Responding to another question as to whether joint atomic tests are common practice, he said that America had openly conducted nuclear test in the Nevada Desert for Britain in 1990.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said that we also speculate that Israel was also provided access to the results of this test.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thomas Reed was also asked whether China's atomic proliferation program continues.</seg>
<seg id="15">At this, Thomas Reed said that since 1991China had been providing raw materials, instructions and design for the nuclear installation in the Iranian city, Isfahan.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition to this, China also provided Iran with the enrichment plant in Karaj</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that China had been providing atomic technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen through North Korea.</seg>

</hl>
<seg id="2">On Tuesday, journalists and news personnel, under the umbrella of Islamabad journalists' organization RIUJ, protested and shouted slogans in front of Islamabad Press Club against the owners of media organizations and government on the dismissal of a large number of employees working in television channels and newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Addressing the protesters, C.R. Shamsi, senior member of the largest journalist organization, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, said that the politicians who were, till yesterday, protesting with us on the roads, are sitting as rulers in the parliament but they are not doing anything for the rights of journalists because of the fear of a particular group of newspaper owners</seg>
<seg id="4">He said that the newspaper owners who talk about human rights have turned their institutions into prisons and slave labor camps where despite the earnings of billions of rupees annually, workers are being paid very low wages and hundreds of them are being killed economically because of their dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="5">An example of this is in front of us as an employee of Lahore based private TV channel 5 committed suicide because he did not get his salary for four months. Even today, many employees are living in hardship because of forced expulsions and non payment of salaries for months.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that right steps should be taken against owners of TV channels and newspapers and a permanent protest camp should be put in front of the parliament for the rights of journalists.</seg>
<seg id="7">C. R. Shamsi criticized Punjab Governor, Salman Taseer, saying that employees are being dismissed from his Urdu newspaper 'Aajkal' without any notice.</seg>
<seg id="8">Whereas the Daily Jinnah, Daily Khabrain, Channel 5, Business Plus TV and AaJ TV too have dismissed dozens of employees.</seg>
<seg id="9">Addressing the protesters, Secretary General of PUFJ, Mazhar Abbas, said that journalist organizations all across the country are observing today as a black day against the dismissal of journalists and newspaper employees, while the journalists will go to the parliament session wearing black bands around their arms in order to claim their rights.</seg>

<seg id="1">Role of European Union for Peace in Middle East</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">If seen officially, the European Union has a decisive role to play in the efforts to establish peace in the Middle East</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the official position of Brussels, efforts of Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy are equivalent to lending a supportive hand in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="4">Spokesman for the European Commission, Amadeu Altafaj, said, any such effort is commendable that will help to convey the joint message of the European Union to the warring factions.</seg>
<seg id="5">As far as the official statement is concerned everything seems fine.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in reality, the European Union presents a sad picture of internal conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="7">Role of the Czech Republic as President of the Union is already weak.</seg>
<seg id="8">On top of it, the internal conflicts have rendered it helpless.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the other hand, the French President is behaving as if he is still discharging his duties as the President of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although France has already completed its six month term.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he does have the ability to do that but he does not have permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="12">French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner finds himself in the most absurd situation</seg>
<seg id="13">He is part of the delegation that is being led by the Foreign Minister of Czech Republic, Schwarzenberg.</seg>
<seg id="14">On top of that, both Foreign Ministers are giving divergent statement regarding the Middle East war.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kouchner believes that Israel has the right to defend itself whereas according to Schwarzenberg this war does not fall under the category of self defense. On the other hand Germany has also dispatched its special envoy to the Middle East. Until the European Union shows cohesiveness in its stand it can never be successful at the diplomatic front.</seg>
<seg id="16">The proof for this is Israeli attitude that does not give any credence to the peace initiatives of Europe</seg>
<seg id="17">This is a golden opportunity for the European Union to do something because America has failed in the Middle East due George W. Bush's policies.</seg>

</hl>
<seg id="2">Adolf Merckle of south Germany has left behind a huge business group.</seg>
<seg id="3">But a little while ago ordinary German citizen did not know much about him.</seg>
<seg id="4">And when he had to negotiate for several weeks with nearly 30 banks that gave loans to his business group, he came into limelight and he could also see the future of Merckle Group as bleak.</seg>
<seg id="5">Merckle Group faced loss of several hundred million euros after buying shares of the German car manufacturer Volks Wagen, due to the economic crisis.</seg>
<seg id="6">After that, when financial institutions declined to lend to this Group the required loan of 700 million to 1 billion euros, Merckle came under immense pressure.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some time ago, the same banks had agreed to give loan on emergency basis to the Merckle Group, but Adolf Merckle who started as a small industrialist and rose to this position and the annual income of whose industrial group was around 30 billion euros could not bear the loss of his investment powers.</seg>
<seg id="8">When Adolf Merckle took over the family business after the death of his father, he organized it on modern principles and soon made enormous progress.</seg>
<seg id="9">He named his company Ratiopharm, which today is a highly successful and a very large drug manufacturing company in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until some time ago, the business worth of this pharmaceutical company was between 5 and 6 billion euros and it still makes an annual income of 8.1billion euros. After the tremendous success of Ratiopharm, Merckle Group acquired many large companies; ranging from the building and construction material company, Heidelberg Cement, to the special vehicles manufacturing company, Kaessbohrer.</seg>
<seg id="11">The worldwide workforce of Merckle Group is almost 100,000 persons, and Ratiopharm pharmaceutical company has always enjoyed special significance.</seg>
<seg id="12">During his life Adolf Merckle said on several occasions, "We have been making medicine for the last four generations.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now the control of this company is in the hands of my children and I hope that for the next few hundred years it will remain under the administration of my family.</seg>
<seg id="14">After Adolf Merckle's suicide, the banks have approved 400 million euros of bridge VEM loan for his group but on the condition that Ratiopharm has to be sold so that the VEM financial condition of this group can be improved over a long term.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also, after the death of Adolf Merckle the Merckle Group will not be the same as it used to be.</seg>

<seg id="3">has fallen from 22 percent to 21</seg>
<seg id="4">per cent.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the Interior Minister of Bavaria province, Joachim Herrmann, this is just a superficial positive change.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said, "It should be kept in mind that the number of foreigners obtaining German citizenship is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Therefore, statistics should mention that although the one committing crime is a German citizen; his background is foreign.</seg>
<seg id="8">Herrmann said that his province will keep this in consideration while gathering statistics from 2010 onward.</seg>
<seg id="9">Apart from Bavaria, Hamburg is also thinking on these lines.</seg>
<seg id="10">Senator of Interior Affairs, Christoph Ahlhaus, from CDU said, "When research is carried out on scientific lines, one cannot make conclusions of one's choice but they depend on the statistics gathered as a result of research.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ahlhaus drew attention to an analytical report of the provincial office on the prevention of crimes which had been prepared in July, 2006 and which ascertained the rate of crimes among foreigners in Bergdorf area of Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="12">Results suggested that the crime rate among the foreigners here</seg>
<seg id="13">was lower than that of crimes committed in all other areas of the province.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the contrary, when the youth crime rate in Berlin during 2006 was analyzed, it became obvious that the rate of crimes in youths with foreign background</seg>
<seg id="15">was 44 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, Germany's other political parties such as SPD, the party of environmentalists and leftwing party Linkspartei are against the proposalthat data should be collected about foreign background of German citizens in the crime related statistics.</seg>

<seg id="4">The video message has Arabic subtitles as well.</seg>
<seg id="5">Al-Qaeda logo is displayed the side of the screen and the date October 2008, shows in the video.</seg>
<seg id="6">This message says to the German government that the deployment of such a large number of troops in Afghanistan indicates that this country believes it will not be attacked-this is nothing but foolishness.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although this person, who called himself Abu Talha, did not threaten direct attacks on Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently, the number of German soldiers in Afghanistan, in NATO's coalition army, is 3,500.</seg>
<seg id="9">In October last year, German parliament gave the legal authorization for deployment of an additional 1000 soldiers to Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the first message from Al-Qaeda, received by Germany.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mikhail LUEDERS, an renowned expert on terrorist affairs, said regarding this message: "The recent suicide attack outside the German Embassy in Kabul is proof that we must take it seriously in every way.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the last few years, Al-Qaeda has been posting video messages on the internet, and such messages have also been followed by attacks.</seg>
<seg id="13">Militant organization, Taliban, assumed responsibility for the suicide attack outside the German Embassy in Kabul on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Most German newspapers and analysts are seeing this attack linked to the Al-Qaeda message.</seg>

<seg id="3">Without taking note of India's unnecessary hullabaloo, the expression of satisfaction over Pakistan's efforts by the United Nations and the appreciation by the Interpol's head of Pakistani efforts is the 'side-effect' of India's over enthusiastic diplomacy.</seg>

<seg id="6">The name of Jama'at-ud-Da'wah has also surfaced time and again in this connection.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is not the first time that the relations between the two countries have suffered on account of some act of terrorism in India.</seg>

<seg id="1">Most of the elders of my family belonged to labor class</seg>

<seg id="3">To avoid this, I wrote a letter to the editor of Daily Imroz and asked him what I should do after matriculation so that I did not have to do hard labor.</seg>
<seg id="4">The editor replied that I should become doctor or engineer and start studying the respective subjects.</seg>
<seg id="5">From the beginning, I was inclined towards engineering and in the matriculation I had studied Technical Drawing instead of Biology.</seg>
<seg id="6">But at the time of admission in F.Sc., my elder brother forced me to do F.Sc. in pre-medical and become a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="7">I studied Biology hardly for one month and when I could not understand a word of it, I exchanged it for Mathematics.</seg>
<seg id="8">I mean the fear of menial labor made an engineer of me and now I am at a very good position among many of my peers and am always thankful to God for this blessing.</seg>
<seg id="9">I was reminded of this when I was trying to lift the carpets from my old home with the help of my two young sons.</seg>

But despite these deaths, not only have the Taliban consolidated even further but according to one estimate, their control has spread to almost eighty percent of Swat.</seg>

<seg id="11">And the sad part of it is that the plane of the company sank in this financial crisis.</seg>

<seg id="2">The committee's meeting was held on Friday at the Parliament House under the chairmanship of Committee Chairman Mushahid Hussain. The Committee proposed to the government to send a parliamentary delegation comprised of represenatives of all parties to Palestine, in addition to sending relief items.</seg>
<seg id="3">Talking to media representatives after the meeting, Mushahid Hussain Syed said that the Committee welcomed the French proposal, which urged Israel to announce an immediate ceasefire and allow access for relief activities in the war-torn areas of Gaza.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Senate Chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs also criticized the lukewarm reaction of Muslim leaders regarding the Palestinian issue.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that the Committee expressed hope that newly-elected US President Barack Obama would address the Muslim community in the first 100 days after taking office in order to bridge the gap between the Muslim world and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">He said that not only should urgent steps be taken to bridge the gap between the Muslim world and the West, but festering issues like Palestine and Kashmir should also be resolved.</seg>

<seg id="1">'First nuclear test conducted in 1990'</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Thomas Reed, who has worked as a weapons designer at Livermore National Laboratory in the United States, has written a book in collaboration with Danny Stillman, former director of the technical intelligence division at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="3">In their book, 'The Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and its Proliferation,' Reed and Stillman claim that every country that has ever produced a nuclear bomb has been able to do so because it stole the nuclear secrets of another country or enjoyed the cooperation of another nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an interview with US News and World Report, Reed alleged that it was China who conducted the first nuclear test for Pakistan in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's first term in office.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas Reed said that he was sure that China had conducted Pakistan's nuclear testing for several reasons.</seg>
<seg id="6">These reasons included the design of the bomb and information gathered in interviews with Chinese scientists.</seg>
<seg id="7">He added that this was why Pakistan was able to conduct nuclear testing in 1998 just two weeks and three days after India's nuclear explosions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Reed recalled that in 1961, the former Soviet Union had conducted a surprise nuclear test and the United States took 17 days to respond, despite the fact that it had possessed nuclear bombs for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="9">He added that the bomb that Pakistan tested in 1998 was made with extreme care and Pakistani scientists had complete trust in its effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Reed was asked if China had also provided Pakistan with nuclear technology, he replied that India was the common enemy of both Pakistan and China.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that there was evidence that Dr Abdul Qadir Khan had used the Chinese model, a fact that was later confirmed by documents from Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">In response to another question, whether conducting joint nuclear testing was a routine occurrence, he said that the United States openly carried out nuclear tests for Britain in the Nevada desert in 1990.</seg>
<seg id="13">He added that Israel was presumably given access to the results of these tests.</seg>
<seg id="14">Reed was also asked whether China was continuing its nuclear proliferation program.</seg>
<seg id="15">Reed responded that China had provided the raw materials, instructions and design for the nuclear installation at Isfahan in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="16">China has also provided Iran with its enrichment plant at Kherej.</seg>
<seg id="17">Reed added that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Jordan through North Korea.</seg>

The participants were chanting slogans.</seg>
<seg id="3">Addressing the protesters, CR Shamsi, a senior member of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, the main representative organization of journalists in Pakistan, said that Pakistani politicians, who were on the streets protesting alongside the journalists a few days back, were doing nothing for journalists' rights now that they were in the corridors of power, adding that they were in fear of newspaper owners and a particular unspecified group.</seg>
<seg id="4">Shamsi said that newspaper owners who pay lip service to human rights have turned their organizations into torture cells and concentration camps, and despite earning billions of rupees every year, media organizations were employing workers on extremely low salaries while hundreds were being sacked, thus committing financial murder.</seg>
<seg id="5">There is the example of a worker at a Lahore-based TV channel, who committed suicide when his salary was not paid for four months. Hundreds more media workers are upset over forced terminations and non-payment of salaries.</seg>
<seg id="6">Shamsi said that actions should be taken against the owners of Pakistani newspapers and TV channels and asserted that a permanent protest camp needed to be set up in front of Parliament House to express support of journalists' rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lashing out at Punjab's governor Salman Taseer, Shamsi said that employees from Taseer's newspaper, Aaj Kal, were being sacked without any prior notice.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the same time, Daily Jinnah, Daily Khabrain, Channel 5, Business Plus TV and Aaj TV have also sacked dozens of their workers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Addressing the protesters, Mazhar Abbas, secretary general of the PUJF, said that today journalists' organizations across the country were observing a "black day" over the sacking of media workers, adding that journalists would express their protest at Parliament House by wearing black arm bands.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Abbas, 85 percent of workers at newspapers and TV channels in Pakistan are being exploited and are being forced to work without any formal contract.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that over 200 journalists and workers have been sacked from newspapers and TV channels so far, and it is feared that the owners of these media outlets will throw out hundreds more employees this year on the pretext of the global recession.</seg>

<seg id="6">And when banks refused to provide him the 700 to 1 billion Euro loan that was crucial to his group's survival, he came under further pressure.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier, these same banks had agreed to provide loans to the Merckle Group on an emergency basis, and Adolf Merckle, who had risen from being a small industrialist to leading a group with an annual income of 30 billion Euros, could not bear the collapse of his industrial empire.</seg>
<seg id="8">After taking charge of the family business following his father's death, Adolf Merckle developed it along modern lines and saw it flourish.</seg>
<seg id="9">He named his company Ratiopharm, which is now a leading pharmaceutical company in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">The pharmaceutical company's dividends rose to 5-6 billion Euros, yet it still earned an annual profit of 8.1 billion Euros. After Ratiopharm's success, the Merckle Group purchased shares of major corporations, including HeidelbergCement and car manufacturer Kaessbohrer.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Merckle Group employs around 100,000 people worldwide and Ratiopharm also plays a vital role for the Group's finances.</seg>

<seg id="4">Research provided by the Moft Cancer Center in the US state of Florida said that women below the age of 50 can reduce the risk of breast cancer</seg>

<seg id="7">The American Medical Association says that several health problems can be caused by lack of exercise.</seg>
<seg id="8">Dr. Patricia Pellikka of the Mayo Clinic says that aging is a major cause of disability and slow performance of the body.</seg>

<seg id="13">The experts focused on the left part of the heart, which is the main organ for pumping blood.</seg>

<seg id="1">There is no doubt that most of the members of Jamat-ud-dawa are comprised of Lashkar-e-Taiba cadets who joined the newly formed Jamat-ud-dawa after the Pakistani government banned Lashkar-e-Taiba.</seg>

<seg id="1">There was once a Muslim League (N). It also has documented an 18th Amendment and given it to the People's Party.</seg>
<seg id="2">Earlier, the MQM and the Muslim League (Q) had submitted an 18th Amendment Bill in the National Assembly and Senate.</seg>
<seg id="3">Until now, it seems that the 18th Amendment is only a political gimmick, and no one is sincere in getting it passed.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the reason why no one has created any uproar about this bill in the Assembly or the Senate floor to pressure the house to get this bill passed.</seg>
<seg id="5">It seems that, by only submitting the amendment bill, they cleared the air and can say that they had submitted the amendment but the government had not acted on it.</seg>
<seg id="6">The MQM is an ally of the government, the Muslim League (N) is supporting it from behind, and the Muslim League (Q) is the party which will get the 17th Amendment passed. Then how it is possible that these parties are sincere about abolishing the 17th Amendment?</seg>
<seg id="7">This is just eyewash.</seg>
<seg id="8">As it is, the People's Party is not in a hurry to abolish the 17th Amendment.</seg>
<seg id="9">How can one think of getting his own hands chopped off?</seg>
<seg id="10">The 17th Amendment cannot be abolished as long as Zardari is there.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is what majority of us said in a survey, and this only is true.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the 17th Amendment had been abolished, Zardari would have never become President.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now he is more powerful than Pervez Musharraf because he is not only the President but also the Chairman of People's Party.</seg>
<seg id="14">As long as he is the President, the 17th Amendment will remain intact.</seg>
<seg id="15">To abolish the 17th Amendment, political parties will have to remove President Zardari from the Presidential House first.</seg>

<seg id="1">Most of our ancestors belonged to the labor class,</seg>
<seg id="2">and in our childhood, when we used to see our uncles and maternal uncles selling things on handcarts, we would pray to Allah to save us from physical labor.</seg>
<seg id="3">To save us from that, we wrote a letter to the editor of Daily Imroz and asked as to what one should do after Metric to be saved from physical labor.</seg>
<seg id="4">The editor replied that we should become a doctor or an engineer, and suggested a few subjects.</seg>
<seg id="5">As it is, we were interested in engineering, and we passed our Metric exams in technical drawing, not biology.</seg>
<seg id="6">But when we went to take admission in FSC, my elder brother forced us to take admission in medical FSC and become a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="7">We hardly studied biology for a month, and when we couldn't understand, we exchanged it for mathematics.</seg>
<seg id="8">That means, fear from physical labor had made us engineers, and now we are in a much better position in our family and we thank Allah for that.</seg>
<seg id="9">We realized this while we were laying a carpet in our old house with our two young sons.</seg>
<seg id="10">We were into the work for about half an hour when my younger son said, "Dad, we are not born to do this it seems."</seg>
<seg id="11">We said, "If it is true, then study hard like us and keep away from physical labor."</seg>
<seg id="12">The son said, "I am studying and will study but I cannot do this work."</seg>
<seg id="13">We finished that work somehow in three hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is meant to say that if a man decides his destination, no matter what comes his way, no one can stop him from reaching there.</seg>

<seg id="1">It is said that one should not speak ill of the dead, but what could one do when only bad things are seen on the first anniversary of the death of Benazeer?</seg>
<seg id="2">On the one hand, Benazeer had arranged the list of Sikhs who were fighting for their freedom in India, and suppressed their movement, and on the other hand, she had given India a chance after suppressing the Punjab movement in order to concentrate on Kashmir.</seg>
<seg id="3">The rift of power between Benazeer and Nawaz Shareef is a part of history that has pushed the country many years back.</seg>
<seg id="4">During her banishment, Benazeer continued to give statements against Kashmir and the nuclear program.</seg>
<seg id="5">Benazeer had dealt with General Musharraf, dishonoring his agreement with Nawaz Shareef in London.</seg>
<seg id="6">Benazeer, during his tenure, allowed her husband to earn much money. This has earned him the name of Mr. Ten Percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her brother was killed when she was in power, and his assassins are still at large.</seg>
<seg id="8">Being a woman, Benazeer never raised her voice about women's rights.</seg>
<seg id="9">The way Benazeer created her politics on her father's dead body, in the same way her widower husband is playing politics on her dead body.</seg>
<seg id="10">Benazeer came to power twice, but she could not arrest the political killers of her father, and could not even initiate a case against them.</seg>

<seg id="2">Provincial Congress is preparing to hold him accountable and remove him from the post of Governor. One of our American white friends who keeps an eye on the situation in Pakistan challenged us proudly and said, "Look, this is democracy."</seg>
<seg id="3">In America, even the biggest man is not above the law,</seg>
<seg id="4">and there is your country Pakistan whose President got his charges dropped to become the President.</seg>
<seg id="5">My witty nature did not let me take a back seat, so I said, so what if one governor is arrested in America? In our Pakistan, one Prime Minister was arrested in the night to be hanged and other was banished.</seg>

<seg id="7">It is also possible that Zardari's promise-breaking stories have reached them, and so they made an allowance for that.</seg>

<seg id="1">One year of army action has passed in the disturbed border province of Swat, and the situation is going from bad to worse.</seg>
<seg id="2">On the one hand, the government is limited in this area to repeating to move a condemnation writ in the national assembly, and on the other hand, Taliban's illegal FM Radio is enjoying immense popularity in Swat.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thirdly, common citizens find it fit to obey the one who is practically in charge of this area.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Swat, during the operations of security forces, they claimed to kill ..... fundamentals through their gunship helicopters and cannons, but despite these killings, the Taliban is not only becoming stronger but, according to an estimate, are practically ruling eighty percent of Swat.</seg>
<seg id="5">The result is, while the government is not ready to accept its defeat, the Taliban is well established there.</seg>
<seg id="6">Who is caught between the line of fire? Poor citizens.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Swat, it is now said, someone asked what kind of people are Taliban. Another answered, very good, because they are the custodians of religion and fight against the 'enemies of Allah and religion.'</seg>
<seg id="8">Again asked, how is the army? Someone answered, very good because they 'defend the country and fight against the enemies of the country.'</seg>

<seg id="3">And the measures that were expected, shattered.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Bush's tenure came to an end, he also became worried about the end of his government and quickly dealt with thieves.</seg>
<seg id="5">Even after that, General Musharraf could have controlled the army, but who knows what is happening with the present government?</seg>

<seg id="1">If the wife of a 50-55 year old man or a husband of a wife of the same age passed away in our society and they opt for a second marriage, why don't we see this positively?</seg>
<seg id="2">A Pakistani uncle lives nearby, his wife expired about 10-12 years ago. Now after marrying off all his children, when he married a widow, his children turn against him.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to me, it is his Sharia right. What do you say?</seg>
<seg id="4">We can't see anyone taking the place of our mother, we can't tolerate it. What kind of thinking is this?</seg>

<seg id="1">Federal thinking controls our actions.</seg>
<seg id="2">Here also, the same thinking seems to be functioning in that new people will be sharing in ancestral property and then they oppose it. Otherwise what their father had done is commendable and could be imitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">As far as relationships are concerned, these restrictions created social problems.</seg>
<seg id="4">Getting a divorcee or a widow married is becoming tougher with passing time.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because of these unnecessary customs and traditions, the family system is on the verge of dispersion.</seg>

<seg id="1">According to me, the children of that person should see it logically that if he married a widow, after marrying off all his children, what is wrong in that?</seg>
<seg id="2">This way, that widow got support and that uncle also got someone to look after his home.</seg>
<seg id="3">; Because his children would definitely be engaged and happy in their own world and would not be able to devote time to him.</seg>

<seg id="1">The reason for this is illiteracy.</seg>
<seg id="2">If tomorrow, their wives refuse to serve the former, what will they do?</seg>
<seg id="3">This is a result of societal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="4">When people make fun of such families for doing something like this, then the chilren are ashamed of their parents' second marriage.</seg>
<seg id="5">This situation should be fought against, and it should be mentioned that their father acted according to Islamic law.</seg>

<seg id="1">This is a curse in our society that has hunted us down in last 40-50 years.</seg>
<seg id="2">A wife can bear an illegitimate relationship of her husband, but would not allow him a second marriage.</seg>
<seg id="3">If it is possible they would not allow to do it even after their death.</seg>
<seg id="4">They ruin their Aakhirat along with that of their husbands and become a huge reason to spread this filth in society.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nothing happens by only blowing the trumpet of Islam. We actually like whatever is in our culture and custom.</seg>
<seg id="2">For example TV, vehicles and keeping girls away from education, and there is a fear about marrying by one's own choice.</seg>
<seg id="3">As far as your question is concerned, then Mister, why do you bring a widow home? Instead, you should be going to her house so that the relatives keep quiet after creating artificial havoc (well, there will be a stomach ache in the widow's family).</seg>

<seg id="1">In the Indo-Pak sub-continent, we embraced Islam many centuries ago, but we could not get away with this thinking and preferred customs and traditions to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2">Because of this pattern of thinking, we consider a second marriage of a male as bad, divorce as a blot, divorcee women an untouchable, marriage of one's choice as a stain on one's honor, and marriage of a man with an aged woman is considered a deceitful tactics of the woman.</seg>
<seg id="3">On top of that, while imitating the West, we condemn prayers and Pardah as old fashioned.</seg>
<seg id="4">Embracing Islam was easy but getting away from this thought was tough.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatahu,</seg>
<seg id="2">Today, after Isha prayers, when I was coming towards my shop, a man who was sitting in a vehicle raised his hand and summoned me.</seg>
<seg id="3">I thought this man has forgotten his way or wanted to ask something. I stopped, and when I looked into the car, his whole family was in it.</seg>
<seg id="4">He asked me if I understand Arabic well. I said, no problem; tell me what is the matter.</seg>
<seg id="5">He started saying, "I came from Riyaz to Madinah but someone picked my pocket. Please help me." I asked for an excuse because one such incident had happened to me even earlier. I gave that man a note of 20 Riyals to get the gasoline to go back to Riyaz, but after going a little ahead he started to do it again.</seg>
<seg id="6">I got very angry- I shouted at him and threatened to call the police. Then he ran away.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is the situation of us Muslims- we come with our families in cars to beg and earn at least two to three thousand a day.</seg>
<seg id="8">While there is a clear Hadith (PBUH), the upper hand is better than the underhand, and the upper hand is the hand of the giver.</seg>

<seg id="2">A highly-placed American official said that President Obama will take a tough stand about Afghan president Hamid Karzai.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the new Afghan policy of America, war is preferred to development.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials said that Hamid Karzai is seen as a hurdle in achieving American goals because corruption prevails in the government, the drug business is flourishing, and Taliban is becoming united once again.</seg>
<seg id="5">American officials said that the people in the American administration who are pressurizing Karzai to take more action are Vice President Joe Biden and Obama's representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that this strategy surfaced after Bush, who would talk to Hamid Karzai on a video conference every two weeks and highlight America's role in re-building new urban institutions in Afghanistan, left office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Officials said that the Obama administration will work with provincial leaders as an alternative to the central government.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officials said that they would pressurize Hamid Karzai to wage a tough war against corruption.</seg>

<seg id="1">President Bush, after governing America for eight years, has moved from the White House to the Presidential Office at Camp David so that the White House could be decorated and renovated according to the wishes of the new President, Barak Obama.</seg>
<seg id="2">In the eight years of the Bush administration, America has seen the historic attack and destruction of the Twin Towers, the attack on the Pentagon, after which he recruited armies from various countries in the name of the fight against terror, taking military action against Afghanistan and Iraq, for which he used huge amounts of American resources. These are some of the memories from his time in government.</seg>
<seg id="3">Because of this war, America has had to face the worst economical and financial crisis in history.</seg>
<seg id="4">What has the world gained, and lost, as a result of this war?</seg>
<seg id="5">Have President Bush's policies been successful?</seg>
<seg id="6">What is your opinion about President Bush's tenure?</seg>

<seg id="1">The Indian Government has cancelled the Indian team's tour to Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2">India was going to play three tests, five one-day matches and one twenty-20 match during the tour.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rajeev Shukla, vice-president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India told Geo TV that the Board had asked the government for permission to tour Pakistan, but the request was denied because of the current tensions between the two countries and that the tour will not be possible.</seg>
<seg id="4">Is it fair on the part of Indian government to cancel the tour, basing its reasoning on the current political situation, or do you think that sports and politics should be kept separate?</seg>
<seg id="5">Is this decision made by the Indian government harmful to cricket?</seg>
<seg id="6">A security threat exists in India, as well, so why was England's team able to tour India despite the situation, and why can't India tour Pakistan?</seg>
<seg id="7">Please send your opinion on this matter.</seg>

<seg id="2">People who feel a sense of pride after visiting India</seg>
<seg id="3">and those who make movies and videos there should recognize by now the reality of how much respect Indians have for them.</seg>
<seg id="4">I remember one of Adnaan Sami's interviews, in which he said that he was not Pakistani, but a British citizen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Adnaan Sami should return to Pakistan at the first available opportunity, as he could not command respect even there.</seg>

<seg id="3">India's attitude has changed after the Mumbai attack.</seg>
<seg id="4">Jagjeet Singh has reacted to it by saying that he hates Pakistan and the Pakistanis.</seg>
<seg id="5">It should be noted that Adnaan Sami sang with Asha Bhonsle. How can he, all of a sudden, start singing "out of tune?" Adnaan Sami should stay in India forever and never come back here again.</seg>

<seg id="2">Karachi. Regarding Jagjit Singh's statement, I would just like to say that he also changes color like a chameleon.</seg>
<seg id="3">and makes statements according to the needs of the hour. Oh Pakistanis! Open your eyes and see for yourself how much you are appreciated in India. Try to understand the Hindu mentality.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the Mumbai attack, their statements of hate have increased. Now they are spitting fire at the famous singer Adnaan Sami.</seg>

<seg id="1">According to an international news agency, the situation for US President Bush, who was on a visit to Iraq, turned amusing when, during a joint press conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nour al-Maliki, an Iraqi journalist shouted at President Bush saying, "Dog, here's a parting kiss."</seg>
<seg id="2">After that, the journalist removed one of his shoes and hurled it at Bush. Because ofBush's alertness, he ducked his head before it could stike and saved himself.</seg>
<seg id="3">The second shoe hit the American flag.</seg>
<seg id="4">Security personnel pounced on the journalist and removed him from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="5">President Bush told the people that he was not aware why the journalist did this, that it was a size 10 shoe, and that he was fine.</seg>
<seg id="6">What do you think? Is this act of the journalist an indication of popular Iraqi sentiment?</seg>

<seg id="1">After the Mumbai terror attack, the tension between India and Pakistan grew to a new high when an Indian Air Force aircraft breached Pakistani air borders over the Lahore and Kashmir sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Due to the Pakistan Air Force's retaliation, Indian aircrafts had to go back.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to sources, both Indian planes were loaded with weapons and explosives.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the current tense situation, this is a unique incident.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the Pakistan Air Force, it is completely equipped to defend the country.</seg>
<seg id="6">Information Minister Sherry Rahman said that the Indian government accepted that there is a breach of air boundaries, but that this happened by mistake.</seg>
<seg id="7">Pakistani military sources termed this incident as serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">What do you think? Does India really want to perform an air strike on Pakistan?</seg>
<seg id="9">Is India's stance that the air breach was a mistake the truth, or did India want to analyze the capabilities of the Pakistan Air Force?</seg>
<seg id="10">Will this incident increase the tension between the two countries?</seg>

<seg id="5">It is also true that she sidelined senior leaders in her party to nominate his son to represent the People's Party. What kind of democracy is that?</seg>

<seg id="2">Karachi. Our rulers should understand one thing: that the people against whom they have started these operations are the people who care about Pakistan - those who are bearing all kinds of cruelty but still love Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="3">If there is a war, they will be the people to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Pakistan army.</seg>
<seg id="4">Then you will realize how much love they have. Politics of anger will not solve anything. I think there are possibilities for a conclusive war between the two, so that the anger comes out.</seg>
