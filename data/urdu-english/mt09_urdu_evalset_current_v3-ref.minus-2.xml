<seg id="1">Support of France's Recommendation</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">The Committee meeting was held in Parliament House on Friday under the direction of Committee Chairman Mushahid Hussain Sayed, wherein it was recommended to the government that, in addition to sending relief supplies, it should also send a parliamentary delegation of the representatives of all political parties to Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">After the meeting, Mushahid Hussain Sayed, while talking to the representative of the media, said the Committee has welcomed France's recommendation that Israel immediately call a ceasefire and permit relief activities for victims in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="4">Declaring Israel's attack on Palestinians a crime against humanity, he said that all countries should condemn these attacks.</seg>
<seg id="5">Targeting his criticism against their double standard, Mushahid Hussain questioned the silence of those who speak out against terrorism about Israel's attacks on Palestinians.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs also criticized the apathetic behavior of Muslim leaders on the problem in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that the committee is hopeful that the newly elected American president Barack Obama will address the Muslim world during his first 100 days in office so that the gulf between America and the Muslim world can be bridged.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mushahid Hussain Sayed said that, not only should emergency steps be taken to fill the gap between the Muslim world and the West, but also old problems like those of Kashmir and Palestine should also be solved.</seg>
<seg id="9">Malik Amad Khan, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, told the Committee that he is going to Saudi Arabia to attend the meeting of foreign ministers for the Organization of Islamic Countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">This emergency meeting has been called as a result of Israel's attacks on Palestine. He said that the government is aware of the Palestine issue and is in contact with the leaders of other countries about it.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the problem of Palestine should be solved according to the resolutions of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="12">Two journalists from Arab countries also participated in the meeting and reported the current situation in Palestine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Avoiding Dieting Can Prevent Flu</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">This finding by American scientists has emerged as a result of experiments performed on rats.</seg>
<seg id="3">The experiments proved that the ability to combat the flu virus was lower in rats who were kept on a low-calorie diet.</seg>
<seg id="4">This research has proven wrong the old saying that "while suffering from fever, it is better to abstain from eating."</seg>
<seg id="5">According to scientists, it is better to eat and drink a lot during a fever.</seg>
<seg id="6">Researchers from Michigan State University say that rats on a low diet were found to have less ability to fight off infection and an increased chance of mortality, while rats on a normal diet had greater resistance against the flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Professor Elizabeth Gardner, people on a diet will not only succumb quickly to the flu, but will also take longer to recover.</seg>
<seg id="8">She also says that even people who have taken the flu vaccine should avoid dieting during the winter months.</seg>

<seg id="1">First Nuclear Test Done in 1990</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Thomas Reed, who has worked as a weapon designer in America's Liver National Laboratory, wrote this book in cooperation with Danny Stillman, former Director of Technical Intelligence at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the book, entitled "Nuclear Express: The Political History and Spread of the Bomb," both writers have claimed that any country that has made an atomic bomb has either stolen nuclear secrets from another country or has done so with the support of another nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="4">During one of the interviews with US News, Thomas Reed said that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb in 1990, during the time of Benazir Bhutto.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that his belief that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb is based on several reasons,</seg>
<seg id="6">including the design of the bomb and information collected from conversations with Chinese scientists.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that this is why Pakistan was able to respond in 1998 to India's nuclear test with their own test only two weeks and three days later.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thomas Reed reminded the interviewer how, when Russia conducted a nuclear test in 1961, America responded with its own test only 17 days later, despite the fact that it had had the bomb for quite some time.</seg>
<seg id="9">He added that the nuclear bomb, which Pakistan tested in May 1998, was very carefully made and Pakistani scientists had full confidence in it.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Thomas Reed was asked why China would provide Pakistan with nuclear technology, he responded that it is because India is a common enemy to both Pakistan and China.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that there is evidence that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan used the Chinese design, and that this was later verified through documents acquired from Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">When asked whether it is common for countries to collaborate in nuclear testing, he gave the example of how America expressly conducted a nuclear test for Britain in 1990 in the Nevada desert.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said they also speculate that Israel was provided access to the results of this test.</seg>
<seg id="14">Reed was also asked whether China has plans for continued nuclear expansion.</seg>
<seg id="15">He responded that China has been providing raw materials, guidelines, and designs for nuclear installation in the Iranian city of Isfahan since 1991,</seg>
<seg id="16">and has provided Iran with a production plant in Karaj.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen through North Korea.</seg>

<seg id="1">2008: A Great Year for Madonna</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">The show was based on Madonna's album "Hard Candy" and featured a band of Ukrainian gypsies, or nomads, as well as a duet with Justin Timberlake.</seg>
<seg id="3">An old racing car was also placed onstage.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was the most profitable show since that of Celine Dion in 2008, bringing in $236.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="5">While the Canadian show "Taking Chances" visited twenty-four countries, Madonna went to only seventeen countries as part of her first world tour in the last eight years.</seg>
<seg id="6">Both singers' shows were directed by Jamie King, who had also organized the Spice Girls' "Reunion" tour.</seg>
<seg id="7">Madonna broke her own previous record set in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2006, she had earned $193.7 million from the "Confession" concerts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Pollster declared Bon Jovi to be the third most successful singer, earning $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bruce Springsteen came in fourth, earning $166 million, and the Police in fifth, with $120.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to Pollster, very few people attended concerts and vocal performances in North America in 2008; only those who were able to buy the expensive tickets.</seg>
<seg id="12">In America, the average ticket price increased by eight percent, and the highest-priced ticket for Madonna's show sold for $350.</seg>
<seg id="13">Pollster's editor Gary Bongiovanni said that, taking into account the global economic slump, 2008 proved to be a good year for singers.</seg>
<seg id="14">He has predicted that 2009 will be a good year for U2 and Springsteen, whose albums are soon to be released.</seg>

</hl>
<seg id="2">Local Taliban members of the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group have distributed a pamphlet in Miranshah, the capital of North Waziristan, and in other tehsils in which a threat has been made against government and semi-government educational institutions where boys and girls are provided with co-education.</seg>
<seg id="3">The pamphlet states that if co-ed institutions are not shut down by January 5, then action will be taken against them.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also states that identity cards may not be issued to women for government assistance or any other educational purposes, and women are forbidden to go to the NADRA offices in all tehsils.</seg>
<seg id="5">This announcement forbidding the issuance of identity cards has been made at a time when approximately 200 women have submitted application forms at the NADRA offices to have their identity cards issued for the Benazir Income Support Program in North Waziristan.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the local people, the Taliban's pamphlet was read over the loudspeakers of all mosques in North Waziristan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Nevertheless, it was not stated in writing whether separate educational institutions for girls will be banned or not.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the pamphlet, if any woman is caught trying to get an education from school or her identity card from a NADRA office after this announcement, she and her family will be punished by religious law.</seg>

<seg id="10">On Saturday, Muslim Khan, spokesperson of local Taliban members in Swat, told BBC that three dead bodies among those found on Friday were of his associates, including Devlai's Taliban Commander Rafiullah.</seg>
<seg id="11">Muslim Khan said that Rafiullah was in the custody of security forces for the past month and a half.</seg>
<seg id="12">He said that local Taliban members issue a notice prior to killing someone; on the other hand, the general public has serious concern over these continued incidents in Mingora.</seg>
<seg id="13">Local people say that a large number of security forces have been deployed in Mingora, but despite that, there are increasing attacks on civilians.</seg>

<seg id="1">Protest Against Firing of Journalists</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">On Tuesday in Islamabad, in front of the Islamabad Press Club, under arrangements by the journalists' organization "RIUJ," journalists and newspaper workers protested and shouted slogans against the owners of mass media and the government for the firing of a great number of employees from TV channels and newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="3">When speaking to the demonstrators, C. R. Shamsi - senior member of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, the largest organization of journalists - said that the politicians who used to protest with them on the streets are now sitting in the government as rulers, but are doing nothing for the rights of journalists out of fear of a specific group of newspaper owners.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said that the owners of newspaper who talk about human rights have made their organizations into torture chambers and beggar camps where they pay the workers extremely low wages and financially murder hundreds by firing them, despite earning billions of rupees each year for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="5">The example before us is that of a worker of private TV Channel Five in Lahore who had committed suicide after not being paid for four months; even today, many workers are living under duress due to forced dismissal and not receiving their salaries for months.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that direct steps should be taken against TV and newspaper owners and a permanent protest camp needs to be set up before the Parliament for the rights of journalists.</seg>
<seg id="7">C. R. Shamsi, criticizing Governor of Punjab Salman Taseer, said that employees are being dismissed from his Urdu newspaper "Aaj Kal" without any notice.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Daily Jinnah, Daily Khabrein, Channel Five, Business Plus TV, and Aaj TV have fired dozens of employees,</seg>
<seg id="9">Mazhar Abbas, Secretary General of PUFJ, said, when speaking to demonstrators, that today, throughout the country, journalist organizations are celebrating Black Day against the firing of journalists and newspaper workers, while the journalists will go to the Parliament session to fight for their rights with black bands tied on their arms.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Mazhar Abbas, the workers and journalists are being exploited in eighty-five percent of Pakistan's newspapers and TV channels, where they are working without any contract.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that until now, more than 200 journalists and workers have been dismissed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is feared that during the current year, owners will dismiss hundreds more, justifying this on the basis of the economic crisis.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mazhar Abbas said that the journalists' movement will continue until the workers who were fired are reinstated, the Seventh Wage Board Award that fixes the wages of newspaper workers is implemented, and the salaries of workers of TV channels and newspapers are paid, which have been withheld for months.</seg>

<seg id="6">Meanwhile, Omar Abdullah, the Chief Minister appointed by the coalition government, met with the Governor and gave him official notification of his selection as the leader of the Assembly by his party, the National Conference.</seg>
<seg id="7">National Conference's supportive party Congress also informed the Governor of its support for Omar Abdullah.</seg>
<seg id="8">Omar Abdullah will be given the oath as Chief Minister of State tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="9">It should be noted that in the recent state elections, National Conference, after winning 28 seats in the 87-member House, has emerged as the largest party. Separatist parties had boycotted the elections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Role of European Union for Peace in Middle East</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">When viewed from an official standpoint, the role of the European Union in the conciliatory efforts to stop the war in the Middle East is decisive.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the official stand of Brussels, Schwarzenberg's delegation or Sarkozy's efforts are the equivalent to lending a helping hand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Amadeu Altafaj, spokesperson for the European Commission, said that every effort by which the European Commission's concerted message can be sent to warring parties is praiseworthy.</seg>
<seg id="5">As far as its official statement is concerned, everything looks fine.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in reality the European Union is presenting a sad picture of its own internal tug-of-war.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Union President, the role of the Czech Republic has already been weak.</seg>
<seg id="8">On top of that, internal disputes have rendered it helpless.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the other hand, French President Sarkozy is acting as though he is still performing the presidential duties of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even though France has completed its six-month presidential term.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sarkozy wants to play a leadership role, and he is certainly capable, but he does not have the permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="12">French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner is faced with the most ludicrous situation.</seg>
<seg id="13">He is included in the delegation led by Czech Republic's Foreign Minister Schwarzenberg.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, both Foreign Ministers are making different statements about the war in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend itself, while Kouchner thinks that this war cannot be called one of self-defense. Meanwhile Germany has also sent its own special envoy to the Middle East. Until the European Union demonstrates harmony by taking a united stand, it cannot achieve success on the diplomatic front.</seg>
<seg id="16">Evidence of this is Israel's conduct, which does not show any respect for Europe's conciliatory efforts.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is a golden opportunity for the European Union to do something because America has failed in the Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush.</seg>

<seg id="1">Financial Crisis: Billionaire German Industrialist's Suicide</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Adolf Merckle of Southern Germany's Swabia area has left a large business group behind,</seg>
<seg id="3">but until some time ago the average German citizen did not know much about him.</seg>
<seg id="4">When he had to carry on negotiations for several weeks with the nearly thirty banks who lend money to his industrial group, he became the topic of headlines and began to see the future of the Merckle group as bleak.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Merckle group was forced to suffer millions of euros in losses due to the financial crisis, after purchasing shares of the German Volkswagen manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="6">So when financial institutions refused to make new loans of between 700 million and one billion euros to this group, which they desperately needed, Merckle came under intense pressure.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just recently the same banks had agreed to provide loans to the Merckle group on an emergency basis, but Adolf Merckle, who had moved from being a small industrialist to the position that his industrial group's annual income was approximately 30 billion euros, could not withstand the deprivation of his strength as a capitalist.</seg>
<seg id="8">When Adolf Merckle took charge of his family's business after the death of his father, he greatly improved the business very quickly through a process of modernization.</seg>
<seg id="9">He named his company "Ratiopharm," now the biggest and most successful pharmaceutical company in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until recently the company was worth between 5 and 6 billion euros, and it still generates an annual income of 8.1 billion euros. After the tremendous success of Ratiopharm, the Merckle group purchased several large institutions, including HeidelbergCement, a manufacturer of construction materials, and Kaessbohrer, a manufacturer of special vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="11">The number of Merckle Group employees worldwide is nearly 100,000, and the Ratiopharm pharmaceutical company has always held a special place amongst its assets.</seg>
<seg id="12">In his life Adolf Merckle had said on several occasions, "This is our fourth generation of drug manufacturers.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now this company's administration is with my children and I am hopeful that in the coming few hundred years it will remain under my family's administration."</seg>
<seg id="14">After the suicide of Adolf Merckle, banks approved a temporary loan of 400 million euros to his VEM group, but on the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that the group's financial situation can be improved over the long term.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thus after the death of Adolf Merckle, the Merckle group will not be the same as it used to be.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to recent statistics, between 2004 and 2007 the crime rate of foreigners</seg>
<seg id="3">decreased from 22.9 percent</seg>
<seg id="4">to 21.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Joachim Herrmann, Interior Minister of the Bavarian Province, this only appears to be a positive change.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said, "It is necessary to keep in mind that the number of foreigners obtaining German citizenship is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Therefore, when presenting the statistics, this fact should also be made clear that even when the criminal is a German citizen, his background may be foreign.</seg>
<seg id="8">Herrmann said that in 2010 his province will take this into account when collecting data about criminals.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition to Bavaria, thinking is being done along the same lines in the province of Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="10">CDU's Senator of Internal Affairs Christoph Ahlhaus said, "When research is conducted in a scientific manner, one cannot draw up the results he would like to see ahead of time; they must depend on the data that emerges from the research.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ahlhaus directed attention towards an analytical report from the provincial office of crime prevention prepared in 2006 in which the percentage of foreigners' involvement in crime was studied in the Bergedorf borough of the city of Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="12">Results showed that here</seg>
<seg id="13">the rate of crimes committed by foreigners is less than the crime rate for the entire province.</seg>
<seg id="14">In contrast, when the crime rate amongst adolescents was studied in 2006 in Berlin, it was seen that the rate of adolescents with foreign background was</seg>
<seg id="15">44.7 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, other German political parties, such as SPD, the environmentalist party Garbanz, and the left-wing party Linkspartei, are opposed to the idea of determining which German citizens have foreign background when gathering crime data.</seg>

<seg id="2">In this thirty-minute video a person wearing a black turban, covering his face and carrying a gun in his hand, is sending a message to the German government.</seg>
<seg id="3">The man introduces himself with the name Abu Talha and speaks in German.</seg>
<seg id="4">The video message also has Arabic subtitles.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Al Qaeda logo appears on the side of the screen, and the video is dated October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the message it is stated to the German government that if, by stationing military in such large numbers in Afghanistan, their country means to express its belief that it will not be attacked, what could be more naïve?</seg>
<seg id="7">The person calling himself Abu Talha did not threaten to attack Germany directly, however.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently the number of German troops included in the united NATO army in Afghanistan is approximately 3,500.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, in October, the German Parliament approved a decision to send 1,000 more troops to Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the first message received by Germany from Al Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id="11">Regarding the message, Mikhail Lüders, a distinguished expert on matters of terrorism, says, "The recent suicide attack outside the German Embassy in Kabul is evidence that we should take this very seriously."</seg>
<seg id="12">For the past few years Al Qaeda has been sending video messages on the internet, and these kinds of messages have been followed by attacks.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Saturday, the militant Taliban organization claimed responsibility for the suicide attack outside the German Embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="14">Most German newspapers and advisors consider this attack to be related to the Al Qaeda message.</seg>
<seg id="15">"They are making Germany a target."</seg>
<seg id="16">Fundamentalist Muslims have a negative and critical view of Germany's Afghan policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">They accuse the German government of adopting biased policies, not only in Afghanistan, but in the Middle East as well.</seg>
<seg id="18">And for this reason they very much consider Germany to be their target.</seg>

<seg id="4">This research conducted in the American state of Florida's Moffitt Cancer Center has found that for women less than 50 years of age, the risk of breast cancer tumors</seg>

<seg id="6">Research has also found that drinking three or more cups of tea daily does not hold any particular benefit in this respect for elderly women.</seg>
<seg id="7">Experts think that the reason for this is the presence in tea of some ingredients that are more effective against those particular cancerous tumors that most commonly occur in women under fifty years of age.</seg>
<seg id="8">In Florida state's Moffitt Cancer Center in the city of Tampa, this research was conducted on more than 5,000 women who had been treated for breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Experts compared their medical records and lifestyles to women who did not have breast cancer.</seg>

<seg id="2">New Research</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="3">Exercise is good for the health at every age.</seg>
<seg id="4">It makes your heart stronger, lowers cholesterol levels, helps in keeping weight low, helps prevent diabetes, and slows down the progress of Alzheimer's or senility.</seg>
<seg id="5">Unfortunately, in many people the ability to exercise decreases as age increases.</seg>
<seg id="6">Experts say that exercise keeps our body and mind alert, although age can have an effect on this.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American Medical Association says that not exercising can lead to several health problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">Dr. Patricia Pellikka of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says that increased age is a big reason behind an inability to exercise and a decrease in the body's performance.</seg>
<seg id="9">Doctor Patricia teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.</seg>
<seg id="10">She headed a study about heart disease and the ability of humans to exercise in old age.</seg>
<seg id="11">A team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to examine the performance of the heart</seg>
<seg id="12">in which the heart's pumping of blood, its phases of contraction and relaxation, was observed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Experts have focused their attention on the left side of the heart, the side which pumps the blood.</seg>
<seg id="14">They found that an increase in age is accompanied by an increase in problems in the relaxation phase of the heart.</seg>
<seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says that with increased age the problems in the relaxation phase of the heart become prominent and their effect on the ability to exercise gets worse.</seg>
<seg id="16">Dr. Garvan Kane was a part of this study.</seg>
<seg id="17">He says that "we were surprised to see that this thing has a compulsory effect, which explained how much a poor performance in exercise can be related to the relaxation phase of the heart."</seg>
<seg id="18">Many times blood pressure can become a cause for problems in the functioning of the heart and heart diseases.</seg>

<seg id="1">Even if the ongoing dialogue between Pakistan and India has been disturbed after the Mumbai attacks, both countries should continue the dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="2">If they think of going to war, then both sides will lose human lives.</seg>
<seg id="3">India says that the person they arrested for the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani national and he had also sent a letter in Urdu to Pakistan. However, it is significant to note that initially, when Indian authorities arrested this extremist, they claimed that he was an accomplished engineer, but later they said that his education was only at the fourth grade level, something to be determined.</seg>

<seg id="2">This is also evident from American history.</seg>
<seg id="3">And in the case of an Indian attack, America will achieve its goals while India will foot the bill.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pakistan should make it clear that we would not initiate war, but if an invasion takes place, then discussion of treaty, peace, and ceasefire will not take place until India is completely destroyed or occupied, even if this means our own destruction.</seg>

This is why, after the initial strong international reaction, now the world has reduced its pressure on Pakistan.</seg>

<seg id="7">I studied biology with difficulty for a month, but when I couldn't make heads or tails of it, I changed the subject and took math instead.</seg>
<seg id="8">It means the dread of physical labor made me an engineer and now I have a better job than most of my peers in the family, for which I constantly thank God.</seg>

<seg id="3">No, absolutely not. Sir, religion is what teaches us that there is no black or white, no Punjabi or Muhajir. If there were no religion, half the world would have been destroyed in the battle between blacks and whites and the rest in the animosity between races.</seg>

<seg id="1">Avoid Dieting to Protect Against Flu</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">This research by American scientists has come out as a result of experiments conducted on mice.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experiments proved that the ability to fight the flu virus, relatively decreased in mice kept on a low calorie diet.</seg>
<seg id="4">Research has proved wrong the old saying, to 'starve a fever'.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to scientists one should eat heartily in a fever.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the researchers of Michigan State University, mice on diet were found to have much less ability to fight infection and they had a higher possibility of death, whereas mice on a normal diet had a higher immunity against the flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to professor Elizabeth Gardner, people that are dieting will not only be affected by the flu more quickly but they will also take longer to get well.</seg>
<seg id="8">She also said that those individuals who have already taken the flu vaccine should also avoid dieting during the few months of winter.</seg>

<seg id="1">'First Nuclear Test, Carried Out in 1990'</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Thomas Reed, who has worked as Weapons Designer at America's Lever National Laboratory, wrote this book in coordination with former Director of Technical Intelligence at the Alamos National Laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="3">This book has been written under the title, 'The Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation' and both the writers have claimed in it that every country that has made the atom bomb has either stolen nuclear secrets from another country or has had the cooperation of another atomic power.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thomas Reed said in an interview to the US News that in 1990 China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb during Benazir Bhutto regime.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas Reed said that he believes, based on many reasons, that China had tested Pakistan's first atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reasons include the design of that bomb and information received during conversations with Chinese scientists.</seg>
<seg id="7">He further said that this is why Pakistan was able to carry out atomic test within only two weeks and three days in response to India's atomic tests in 1998.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thomas Reed recalled that Russia had suddenly conducted an atomic test in 1961 and in response to it, it took America seventeen days to conduct a test in spite of the fact that America had that bomb for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="9">He further said that the atom bomb tested by Pakistan in May, 1998, had been made very carefully and Pakistani scientists had full confidence in it.</seg>
<seg id="10">When asked, why China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, Thomas Reed replied, it was because India was the common enemy of China and Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that there was also evidence that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan had in fact used Chinese design, and in addition, the documents that were later acquired from Libya confirm this.</seg>
<seg id="12">Responding to another question as to whether joint atomic tests are common practice, he said that America had openly conducted nuclear test in the Nevada Desert for Britain in 1990.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said that we also speculate that Israel was also provided access to the results of this test.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thomas Reed was also asked whether China's atomic proliferation program continues.</seg>
<seg id="15">At this, Thomas Reed said that since 1991China had been providing raw materials, instructions and design for the nuclear installation in the Iranian city, Isfahan.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition to this, China also provided Iran with the enrichment plant in Karaj</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that China had been providing atomic technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen through North Korea.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Tuesday, journalists and news personnel, under the umbrella of Islamabad journalists' organization RIUJ, protested and shouted slogans in front of Islamabad Press Club against the owners of media organizations and government on the dismissal of a large number of employees working in television channels and newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Addressing the protesters, C.R. Shamsi, senior member of the largest journalist organization, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, said that the politicians who were, till yesterday, protesting with us on the roads, are sitting as rulers in the parliament but they are not doing anything for the rights of journalists because of the fear of a particular group of newspaper owners</seg>
<seg id="4">He said that the newspaper owners who talk about human rights have turned their institutions into prisons and slave labor camps where despite the earnings of billions of rupees annually, workers are being paid very low wages and hundreds of them are being killed economically because of their dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="5">An example of this is in front of us as an employee of Lahore based private TV channel 5 committed suicide because he did not get his salary for four months. Even today, many employees are living in hardship because of forced expulsions and non payment of salaries for months.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that right steps should be taken against owners of TV channels and newspapers and a permanent protest camp should be put in front of the parliament for the rights of journalists.</seg>
<seg id="7">C. R. Shamsi criticized Punjab Governor, Salman Taseer, saying that employees are being dismissed from his Urdu newspaper 'Aajkal' without any notice.</seg>
<seg id="8">Whereas the Daily Jinnah, Daily Khabrain, Channel 5, Business Plus TV and AaJ TV too have dismissed dozens of employees.</seg>
<seg id="9">Addressing the protesters, Secretary General of PUFJ, Mazhar Abbas, said that journalist organizations all across the country are observing today as a black day against the dismissal of journalists and newspaper employees, while the journalists will go to the parliament session wearing black bands around their arms in order to claim their rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Mazhar Abbas, employees and journalists are being exploited in 85% of the newspapers and TV channels where they are working without ant contracts.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that so far, more than 200 journalists and employees are being dismissed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is feared that the owners will dismiss hundreds of more employees during the current year under the pretext of economic crisis.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mazhar Abbas said that the movement of journalists will continue until the dismissed employees are reinstated, the Seventh Wage Board Award specifying the wages of newspaper employees is implemented and salaries unpaid for several months of TV channels and newspaper workers are disbursed.</seg>

<seg id="6">After that, when financial institutions declined to lend to this Group the required loan of 700 million to 1 billion euros, Merckle came under immense pressure.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some time ago, the same banks had agreed to give loan on emergency basis to the Merckle Group, but Adolf Merckle who started as a small industrialist and rose to this position and the annual income of whose industrial group was around 30 billion euros could not bear the loss of his investment powers.</seg>
<seg id="8">When Adolf Merckle took over the family business after the death of his father, he organized it on modern principles and soon made enormous progress.</seg>
<seg id="9">He named his company Ratiopharm, which today is a highly successful and a very large drug manufacturing company in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until some time ago, the business worth of this pharmaceutical company was between 5 and 6 billion euros and it still makes an annual income of 8.1billion euros. After the tremendous success of Ratiopharm, Merckle Group acquired many large companies; ranging from the building and construction material company, Heidelberg Cement, to the special vehicles manufacturing company, Kaessbohrer.</seg>
<seg id="11">The worldwide workforce of Merckle Group is almost 100,000 persons, and Ratiopharm pharmaceutical company has always enjoyed special significance.</seg>
<seg id="12">During his life Adolf Merckle said on several occasions, "We have been making medicine for the last four generations.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now the control of this company is in the hands of my children and I hope that for the next few hundred years it will remain under the administration of my family.</seg>
<seg id="14">After Adolf Merckle's suicide, the banks have approved 400 million euros of bridge VEM loan for his group but on the condition that Ratiopharm has to be sold so that the VEM financial condition of this group can be improved over a long term.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also, after the death of Adolf Merckle the Merckle Group will not be the same as it used to be.</seg>

<seg id="3">has fallen from 22 percent to 21</seg>
<seg id="4">per cent.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the Interior Minister of Bavaria province, Joachim Herrmann, this is just a superficial positive change.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said, "It should be kept in mind that the number of foreigners obtaining German citizenship is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Therefore, statistics should mention that although the one committing crime is a German citizen; his background is foreign.</seg>
<seg id="8">Herrmann said that his province will keep this in consideration while gathering statistics from 2010 onward.</seg>
<seg id="9">Apart from Bavaria, Hamburg is also thinking on these lines.</seg>
<seg id="10">Senator of Interior Affairs, Christoph Ahlhaus, from CDU said, "When research is carried out on scientific lines, one cannot make conclusions of one's choice but they depend on the statistics gathered as a result of research.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ahlhaus drew attention to an analytical report of the provincial office on the prevention of crimes which had been prepared in July, 2006 and which ascertained the rate of crimes among foreigners in Bergdorf area of Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="12">Results suggested that the crime rate among the foreigners here</seg>
<seg id="13">was lower than that of crimes committed in all other areas of the province.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the contrary, when the youth crime rate in Berlin during 2006 was analyzed, it became obvious that the rate of crimes in youths with foreign background</seg>
<seg id="15">was 44 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, Germany's other political parties such as SPD, the party of environmentalists and leftwing party Linkspartei are against the proposalthat data should be collected about foreign background of German citizens in the crime related statistics.</seg>

<seg id="4">The video message has Arabic subtitles as well.</seg>
<seg id="5">Al-Qaeda logo is displayed the side of the screen and the date October 2008, shows in the video.</seg>
<seg id="6">This message says to the German government that the deployment of such a large number of troops in Afghanistan indicates that this country believes it will not be attacked-this is nothing but foolishness.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although this person, who called himself Abu Talha, did not threaten direct attacks on Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently, the number of German soldiers in Afghanistan, in NATO's coalition army, is 3,500.</seg>
<seg id="9">In October last year, German parliament gave the legal authorization for deployment of an additional 1000 soldiers to Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the first message from Al-Qaeda, received by Germany.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mikhail LUEDERS, an renowned expert on terrorist affairs, said regarding this message: "The recent suicide attack outside the German Embassy in Kabul is proof that we must take it seriously in every way.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the last few years, Al-Qaeda has been posting video messages on the internet, and such messages have also been followed by attacks.</seg>
<seg id="13">Militant organization, Taliban, assumed responsibility for the suicide attack outside the German Embassy in Kabul on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Most German newspapers and analysts are seeing this attack linked to the Al-Qaeda message.</seg>
<seg id="15">They are targeting Germany."</seg>
<seg id="16">Fundamentalist Muslims see Germany's Afghan policy with a negative and critical view.</seg>
<seg id="17">They allege German government for adopting a biased policy not only towards Afghanistan but for the Middle East as well.</seg>

<seg id="1">The failure of RAW's attempt to ignite linguistic violence in Karachi at the height of the Mumbai attacks proves that the political elements that used to be on RAW's payroll have now resigned from the service.</seg>
<seg id="2">The murders of Pushto speaking laborers and the Indian threats have awakend the dormant nationalism in Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.</seg>

<seg id="2">The administration can control situation in 1 hour but this is being aggravated on purpose,</seg>
<seg id="3">due to the pressure of political parties on police and rangers, it refrains from taking action.</seg>
<seg id="4">The talks of solidarity are restricted to statements only. The political parties should shun their interests and work for the benefit of the common man.</seg>

<seg id="1">Only the Muslin League (N) remained and now they too have handed a manuscript of the 18th amendment to the Peoples Party.</seg>
<seg id="2">Before this, MQM and the Muslim League (Q) had submitted manuscripts of the 18th amendment in the National Assembly and the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="3">It seems so far that the manuscripts for the 18th amendment are only a political gimmick and no one sincerely wants to have it passed.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is why no one has either vociferously talked about it on the Assembly or the Senate floor or pushed the house to endorse it.</seg>
<seg id="5">It seems as if these parties have hoodwinked people by submitting the manuscripts of the 18th amendment. This means that they have got the justification now that they had submitted the amendment and it was the ruling party's Speaker who did not initiate proceedings on it.</seg>
<seg id="6">MQM is the ally of the government while the Muslim League (N) is the hidden ally and the Muslim League (Q) is the party that passed the 17th amendment, how can these parties be sincere in repealing the 17th amendment.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is sheer cheating.</seg>
<seg id="8">In any case, Peoples Party is in no hurry to repeal the 17th amendment.</seg>
<seg id="9">How can one think of cutting one's own hands?</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as Zardari is the president, the 17th amendment won't be repealed.</seg>
<seg id="11">This precisely was the opinion of the majority of the people in one of our recent surveys and this is also the truth.</seg>
<seg id="12">Had they wanted to repeal the 17th amendment, Zardari would not have become the president.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now, he is even stronger than President Pervez because he is the President and the chairman of the Peoples Party simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="14">As long as he remains the President, the 17th amendment will stand.</seg>

<seg id="1">Most of the elders of my family belonged to labor class</seg>
<seg id="2">and when in my childhood I used to watch my paternal and maternal uncles doing menial labor, I used to pray to God to spare me from such physical hardship.</seg>
<seg id="3">To avoid this, I wrote a letter to the editor of Daily Imroz and asked him what I should do after matriculation so that I did not have to do hard labor.</seg>
<seg id="4">The editor replied that I should become doctor or engineer and start studying the respective subjects.</seg>
<seg id="5">From the beginning, I was inclined towards engineering and in the matriculation I had studied Technical Drawing instead of Biology.</seg>
<seg id="6">But at the time of admission in F.Sc., my elder brother forced me to do F.Sc. in pre-medical and become a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="7">I studied Biology hardly for one month and when I could not understand a word of it, I exchanged it for Mathematics.</seg>
<seg id="8">I mean the fear of menial labor made an engineer of me and now I am at a very good position among many of my peers and am always thankful to God for this blessing.</seg>
<seg id="9">I was reminded of this when I was trying to lift the carpets from my old home with the help of my two young sons.</seg>
<seg id="10">We were not even half an hour into the work when the younger son said, "Dad, I think I was not born to do this work".</seg>
<seg id="11">I said if this were true then he should study diligently like me and get rid of the menial labor.</seg>
<seg id="12">The son said that he was studying and would complete his studies but he could not do that kind of work.</seg>
<seg id="13">Somehow, the three of us completed that work in three hours and returned home.</seg>
<seg id="14">The purpose of narrating this is if one specifies a goal, for whatever reason may there be, nothing could stop him from achieving his goal.</seg>

<seg id="2">On the one hand, she crushed the independence movement of the Sikhs by providing the list of Sikh freedom fighters to India for the sake of her interests, and on the other hand she provided India with the chance to focus on Kashmir after crushing the movement in the Punjab.</seg>
<seg id="3">Benazir and Nawaz Sharif's scramble for power which plunged the country many years back is recorded in history.</seg>
<seg id="4">Benazir continued the streak of negative statements on Kashmir and the nuclear program during her exile.</seg>

<seg id="4">and then there is your country Pakistan whose President has taken office only after getting the corruption charges against him dropped.</seg>
<seg id="5">Our sense of humor was stirred and we replied that the arrest of one Governor in America was not a big deal since in our country one prime minister was arrested and hanged overnight and the other one was exiled in no time.</seg>

<seg id="1">The conditions are steadily getting worse in the troubled areas of Swat in the Frontier province despite the military operation that has been going on for more than a year.</seg>
<seg id="2">On the one hand, the government's writ in this area has been reduced to passage of a resolution of condemnation in the National Assembly and on the other hand the influence of the illegal FM radio channel of the Taliban has been steadily increasing in Swat.</seg>
<seg id="3">The third aspect is that the ordinary citizen finds it convenient to obey the person who is ruling the area.</seg>
<seg id="4">The claims are made about the deaths of many extremists in Swat by the gunship helicopters and in the artillery fire in the operation being conducted by the security forces. But despite these deaths, not only have the Taliban consolidated even further but according to one estimate, their control has spread to almost eighty percent of Swat.</seg>
<seg id="5">Consequently, on the one hand the government is not prepared to concede its failure and on the other hand, the Taliban are more stable.</seg>
<seg id="6">And who has been crushed between the two: the ordinary citizens.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is said in Swat now that someone asked what kind of people Taliban were and the reply came that they were very good since they were the guardians of the faith and were fighting the 'enemies of God and religion'.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then they were asked about the army and the reply was that the army was good because it 'guarded the country and fought against the enemies of the state'.</seg>

<seg id="2">They had been expressing this displeasure everyday by blowing up schools and colleges for women at one place or the other.</seg>

<seg id="1">Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has once again accused that Pakistan is trying to incite the atmosphere of war.</seg>
<seg id="2">And Pakistan uses terrorism as state policy.</seg>
<seg id="3">Addressing the conference of the Chief Ministers in New Delhi, Manmohan Singh said that the terrorist elements are backed by the neighboring countries, particularly by Pakistan</seg>
<seg id="4">and the terrorists involved in Mumbai attacks used naval route and remained safe from the Indian coastguards.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indian Prime Minister said that the Mumbai attacks of November were carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba.</seg>
<seg id="6">He further said that the terrorists were using new techniques and the latest communication systems. They should increase the intensity at the Line of Control from where incursions take place. He said that terrorism would not be tolerated in any form and that was their policy.</seg>

<seg id="2">The committee's meeting was held on Friday at the Parliament House under the chairmanship of Committee Chairman Mushahid Hussain. The Committee proposed to the government to send a parliamentary delegation comprised of represenatives of all parties to Palestine, in addition to sending relief items.</seg>
<seg id="3">Talking to media representatives after the meeting, Mushahid Hussain Syed said that the Committee welcomed the French proposal, which urged Israel to announce an immediate ceasefire and allow access for relief activities in the war-torn areas of Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="4">While terming the Israeli attacks on the Palestinians as crimes against humanity, he said that all countries should condemn these attacks.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Senate Chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs also criticized the lukewarm reaction of Muslim leaders regarding the Palestinian issue.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that the Committee expressed hope that newly-elected US President Barack Obama would address the Muslim community in the first 100 days after taking office in order to bridge the gap between the Muslim world and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">He said that not only should urgent steps be taken to bridge the gap between the Muslim world and the West, but festering issues like Palestine and Kashmir should also be resolved.</seg>

<seg id="1">'First nuclear test conducted in 1990'</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Thomas Reed, who has worked as a weapons designer at Livermore National Laboratory in the United States, has written a book in collaboration with Danny Stillman, former director of the technical intelligence division at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="3">In their book, 'The Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and its Proliferation,' Reed and Stillman claim that every country that has ever produced a nuclear bomb has been able to do so because it stole the nuclear secrets of another country or enjoyed the cooperation of another nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an interview with US News and World Report, Reed alleged that it was China who conducted the first nuclear test for Pakistan in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's first term in office.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas Reed said that he was sure that China had conducted Pakistan's nuclear testing for several reasons.</seg>
<seg id="6">These reasons included the design of the bomb and information gathered in interviews with Chinese scientists.</seg>
<seg id="7">He added that this was why Pakistan was able to conduct nuclear testing in 1998 just two weeks and three days after India's nuclear explosions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Reed recalled that in 1961, the former Soviet Union had conducted a surprise nuclear test and the United States took 17 days to respond, despite the fact that it had possessed nuclear bombs for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="9">He added that the bomb that Pakistan tested in 1998 was made with extreme care and Pakistani scientists had complete trust in its effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Reed was asked if China had also provided Pakistan with nuclear technology, he replied that India was the common enemy of both Pakistan and China.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that there was evidence that Dr Abdul Qadir Khan had used the Chinese model, a fact that was later confirmed by documents from Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">In response to another question, whether conducting joint nuclear testing was a routine occurrence, he said that the United States openly carried out nuclear tests for Britain in the Nevada desert in 1990.</seg>
<seg id="13">He added that Israel was presumably given access to the results of these tests.</seg>
<seg id="14">Reed was also asked whether China was continuing its nuclear proliferation program.</seg>
<seg id="15">Reed responded that China had provided the raw materials, instructions and design for the nuclear installation at Isfahan in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="16">China has also provided Iran with its enrichment plant at Kherej.</seg>
<seg id="17">Reed added that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Jordan through North Korea.</seg>

<seg id="2">Journalists and media workers from newspapers and TV channels held a protest demonstration in front of the Islamabad Press Club on Tuesday under the leadership of RIUJ, an organization of Islamabad-based journalists, to protest the sacking of a large number of employees from newspapers and TV channels. The participants were chanting slogans.</seg>
<seg id="3">Addressing the protesters, CR Shamsi, a senior member of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, the main representative organization of journalists in Pakistan, said that Pakistani politicians, who were on the streets protesting alongside the journalists a few days back, were doing nothing for journalists' rights now that they were in the corridors of power, adding that they were in fear of newspaper owners and a particular unspecified group.</seg>
<seg id="4">Shamsi said that newspaper owners who pay lip service to human rights have turned their organizations into torture cells and concentration camps, and despite earning billions of rupees every year, media organizations were employing workers on extremely low salaries while hundreds were being sacked, thus committing financial murder.</seg>
<seg id="5">There is the example of a worker at a Lahore-based TV channel, who committed suicide when his salary was not paid for four months. Hundreds more media workers are upset over forced terminations and non-payment of salaries.</seg>
<seg id="6">Shamsi said that actions should be taken against the owners of Pakistani newspapers and TV channels and asserted that a permanent protest camp needed to be set up in front of Parliament House to express support of journalists' rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lashing out at Punjab's governor Salman Taseer, Shamsi said that employees from Taseer's newspaper, Aaj Kal, were being sacked without any prior notice.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the same time, Daily Jinnah, Daily Khabrain, Channel 5, Business Plus TV and Aaj TV have also sacked dozens of their workers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Addressing the protesters, Mazhar Abbas, secretary general of the PUJF, said that today journalists' organizations across the country were observing a "black day" over the sacking of media workers, adding that journalists would express their protest at Parliament House by wearing black arm bands.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Abbas, 85 percent of workers at newspapers and TV channels in Pakistan are being exploited and are being forced to work without any formal contract.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that over 200 journalists and workers have been sacked from newspapers and TV channels so far, and it is feared that the owners of these media outlets will throw out hundreds more employees this year on the pretext of the global recession.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mazhar Iqbal said that the journalists' movement will continue until the sacked employees are returned to their jobs, the seventh wage board award is implemented, and workers at newspapers and TV channels are paid their salaries.</seg>

<seg id="3">They opened fire on the army, and in the gun battle that followed, two militants were killed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The spokesman said that one of the killed militants was Zahoor Khanday, a self-styled Tehsil commander of the Hizb operating in Doda for 12 years and an expert in land mines.</seg>
<seg id="5">The other militant was identified as Sajad Hussain, who according to the army had been active since last year.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Acharya, the operation is still ongoing in this forested area because more militants are feared to be hiding there. The army said that two AK-47 rifles were recovered in the initial phase of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Provincial police chief Kuldeep Kumar Khuda, in releasing the statistics for 2008, termed that year as the most peaceful one so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Notably, no violence was reported during the assembly elections held in seven phases during November and December.</seg>
<seg id="9">More than 1350 candidates took part in these elections.</seg>
<seg id="10">It may be recalled that Hizbul Mujahideen have been operating in Jammu and Kashmir for the last 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="11">In July 2000, the Hizb announced a unilateral ceasefire for the first time, after which talks were held between the Indian government and Hizb commanders.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the ceasefire was over in just 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="13">After that, several Hizbul Mujahideen commanders were killed in various encounters.</seg>
<seg id="14">Pakistan's renowned daily, The News, wrote on Thursday that Laskhar-e-Taiba and the Hizbul Mujahideen have decided to review their Kashmir policy.</seg>
<seg id="15">It may be recalled that the two organizations have thus far pursued a policy of resolving the Kashmir dispute through armed conflict.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Punjab's justice minister Rana Sanaullah said that an administrator has been appointed for the Jamaatud Dawa headquarters so that the organization's welfare activities may continue unaffected.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Khalid Waleed, the son-in-law of the head of Jamaatud Dawa, Hafiz Saeed, a high-ranking government official, Khaqan Babr, has been appointed administrator for the hospital, school and other welfare organizations at the headquarters, while the number of police at the centre has also been increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">The UN Security Council imposed a ban on Jamaatud Dawa, after which the Pakistani federal government took action against the organization and put its head, Hafiz Saeed, under house arrest.

<seg id="7">Babr is from the District Management Group (DMG).</seg>
<seg id="8">Waleed said that the Lahore Division commissioner, Khusro Pervez, visited the headquarters on Sunday along with police and civil administration authorities and inspected various sections of the complex. Waleed condemned the government's decision to appoint an administration for Jamaatud Dawa's headquarters and said that the government's actions had already curtailed the number of patients at the hospital as well as students at the school.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, a press release issued by Jamaatud Dawa said that Saeed has written a letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, in which he asked him to lift the sanctions imposed by the Security Council.</seg>

<seg id="8">The president has said his package, which he hopes to sign into law next month, would help create a favourable climate for American business to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="9">The bill would cut taxes for people and businesses by $275 billion, while pumping more than $540 billion into a range of initiatives including road and bridge repairs, increased unemployment benefits, investment in new technology, and renovations of 10,000 schools.</seg>

<seg id="4">EU Commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj drily commented that any effort is welcome, as long as it sends a unified message on behalf of the EU to the parties to the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="5">All is well, as far as official rhetoric is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="6">In reality, the EU is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the one hand, there is the weak Czech president of the EU,</seg>
<seg id="8">hindered by internal squabbling over Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the other hand, there is the former French president of the EU, who would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as EU president.</seg>

<seg id="2">Adolf Merckle, who lived in Swabia, an area of Southern Germany, has left behind a vast business group.</seg>
<seg id="3">But until fairly recently, most Germans didn't know much about him.</seg>
<seg id="4">He became the subject of headlines when he had to negotiate with nearly 30 banks to provide loans to his industrial group and realized that the Merckle Group was doomed.</seg>
<seg id="5">He lost massive amounts of money after a speculative investment in Volkswagen shares went the wrong way, and lost several million Euros due to the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="6">And when banks refused to provide him the 700 to 1 billion Euro loan that was crucial to his group's survival, he came under further pressure.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier, these same banks had agreed to provide loans to the Merckle Group on an emergency basis, and Adolf Merckle, who had risen from being a small industrialist to leading a group with an annual income of 30 billion Euros, could not bear the collapse of his industrial empire.</seg>
<seg id="8">After taking charge of the family business following his father's death, Adolf Merckle developed it along modern lines and saw it flourish.</seg>
<seg id="9">He named his company Ratiopharm, which is now a leading pharmaceutical company in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">The pharmaceutical company's dividends rose to 5-6 billion Euros, yet it still earned an annual profit of 8.1 billion Euros. After Ratiopharm's success, the Merckle Group purchased shares of major corporations, including HeidelbergCement and car manufacturer Kaessbohrer.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Merckle Group employs around 100,000 people worldwide and Ratiopharm also plays a vital role for the Group's finances.</seg>
<seg id="12">Adolf Merckle had said: "Our family has been involved in the production of medicines for four generations.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now this company is being managed by my sons, and I hope that it will remain in the family for centuries to come."</seg>
<seg id="14">Korassio farm will have to be sold to improve the Group's long term financial condition. A bridge loan of 400 million Euros was approved for VEM, but it came through only after Merckle's death.</seg>

<seg id="2">These are the first important elections in this war-torn country since 2005.</seg>
<seg id="3">Over 14,400 candidates are vying for 440 seats in the provincial elections.</seg>
<seg id="4">800,000 police and army troops have been deployed in Iraq to maintain law and order during the elections.</seg>

</hl>
<seg id="2">According to the Urdu service of the news agency Mehr, Israel is continuing its inhuman bombardment of the civilian population on the 16th day of the clash between the evil and righteous in Gaza. About 880 Palestinians have been martyred and 3700 injured in Israel's aerial, ground and naval aggression on Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="3">The martyrs include 275 innocent children who died while mocking the treachery of Arab leaders and the callousness of the so-called global human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="4">Today, the mujaheddin forced the Israeli army to retreat from the Ajeen area of Gaza and demonstrated unparalleled steadfastness and audacity on the basis of the power of their belief in martyrdom, making life difficult for the Zionist enemy.</seg>
<seg id="5">If it were not for Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak's betrayal, the brave and upright mujaheddin of Hamas would have trounced Israel by now, but alongside Israel's blockade of Gaza, Egypt has also put up barricades around Palestinian Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="6">Meanwhile, the Saudi and Jordanian governments are also providing political and economic support to Israel and committing treachery against the innocent Muslims of Gaza.</seg>

<seg id="2">New research reveals that drinking three cups of tea daily</seg>

<seg id="4">Research provided by the Moft Cancer Center in the US state of Florida said that women below the age of 50 can reduce the risk of breast cancer</seg>
<seg id="5">by 37 per cent if they drink at least three cups of tea daily.</seg>
<seg id="6">The research said that the intake of three or more cups of tea by older women does not provide any noteworthy benefits.</seg>
<seg id="7">The experts are of the opinion that tea contains ingredients that are more effective against particular breast tumors that usually target woman below 50 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Moft Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, conducted research on over 5,000 women who underwent breast cancer treatment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their ages ranged from 20 to 74 years.</seg>
<seg id="10">The experts compared their medical records and lifestyle with the women who were safe from breast cancer.</seg>

<seg id="12">About every tenth person with breast cancer has this type of cancer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Pakistani relations have soured and the relationship, which has become smoother in recent years, has been derailed once again.</seg>
<seg id="3">India has always blamed armed and unarmed groups operating in Pakistan,</seg>

<seg id="5">Meanwhile, Indian security organizations have directly blamed Lashkar-e-Taiba for the Mumbai attacks.</seg>

<seg id="7">This is not the first time that the relationship between the two countries has soured because of a terrorist attack.</seg>
<seg id="8">In December 2001, after the attack on the Indian parliament, the two countries were on the brink of war.</seg>
<seg id="9">After that, in 2002, Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned and put on the list of terror groups.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now there is a demand to ban Jamat-ud-dawa, regarding which security analysts are saying that Lashkar-e-Taiba has been putting on a new face for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="11">What do you think, should these groups be banned?</seg>
<seg id="12">Should Pakistan take action against terror groups functioning on its soil?</seg>
<seg id="13">Will a ban of Jamat-ud-dawa break the deadlock between India</seg>

<seg id="1">There is no doubt that most of the members of Jamat-ud-dawa are comprised of Lashkar-e-Taiba cadets who joined the newly formed Jamat-ud-dawa after the Pakistani government banned Lashkar-e-Taiba.</seg>
<seg id="2">However, even though these cadets prefer social work, under strong pressure from India the United Nations also banned the group and the Pakistani government initiated crackdowns against them.</seg>

<seg id="2">On the one hand, Benazeer had arranged the list of Sikhs who were fighting for their freedom in India, and suppressed their movement, and on the other hand, she had given India a chance after suppressing the Punjab movement in order to concentrate on Kashmir.</seg>
<seg id="3">The rift of power between Benazeer and Nawaz Shareef is a part of history that has pushed the country many years back.</seg>
<seg id="4">During her banishment, Benazeer continued to give statements against Kashmir and the nuclear program.</seg>
<seg id="5">Benazeer had dealt with General Musharraf, dishonoring his agreement with Nawaz Shareef in London.</seg>
<seg id="6">Benazeer, during his tenure, allowed her husband to earn much money. This has earned him the name of Mr. Ten Percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her brother was killed when she was in power, and his assassins are still at large.</seg>
<seg id="8">Being a woman, Benazeer never raised her voice about women's rights.</seg>
<seg id="9">The way Benazeer created her politics on her father's dead body, in the same way her widower husband is playing politics on her dead body.</seg>
<seg id="10">Benazeer came to power twice, but she could not arrest the political killers of her father, and could not even initiate a case against them.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thirty-seven years had passed when East Pakistan broke from us, and look at the apathy of our people and leaders that no one even feels sad about it, and no one is beating his chest over a mistake of our own.</seg>
<seg id="2">We should have remembered December 16 as an example and made sure that such things don't happen again.</seg>
<seg id="3">On that day, we could send messages of prosperity to the people of Bangladesh and try again to bring them closer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rulers would open Mehmoodurrahman's files and look into the reasons why Eastern Pakistan broke away.</seg>
<seg id="5">Efforts should have been made to bring back the Biharis who are still strangled in Bangladesh and would have sent gifts to keep their spirits high.</seg>
<seg id="6">But we have become insensitive; if someone dies in our neighborhood, we don't know it.</seg>
<seg id="7">We don't care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.</seg>
<seg id="8">Regardless of what big tragedy occurs, we go about our lives normally the following day.</seg>
<seg id="9">The way East and West Germany became one, I wish East and West Pakistan would become one again.</seg>
<seg id="10">We can once again become one if both sacrifice for each other and come out of the shell of selfishness.</seg>
<seg id="11">But this desire doesn't seem likely to be fulfilled in the near future.</seg>

<seg id="1">Today's news revealed that the Governor of the American state of Illinois has been arrested under corruption charges.</seg>
<seg id="2">Provincial Congress is preparing to hold him accountable and remove him from the post of Governor. One of our American white friends who keeps an eye on the situation in Pakistan challenged us proudly and said, "Look, this is democracy."</seg>
<seg id="3">In America, even the biggest man is not above the law,</seg>
<seg id="4">and there is your country Pakistan whose President got his charges dropped to become the President.</seg>
<seg id="5">My witty nature did not let me take a back seat, so I said, so what if one governor is arrested in America? In our Pakistan, one Prime Minister was arrested in the night to be hanged and other was banished.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tell me if this has ever happened in America?</seg>
<seg id="7">Pakistan had awarded the badge of honor to a law breaker before his departure from the presidential house; tell me if this has ever happened in America?</seg>
<seg id="8">In Pakistan, the Chief Justice was removed, and could not be reinstated even with popular support. Has this ever happened in America?</seg>

<seg id="1">In this picture, President Zardari is smiling even when he is surrounded by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="2">His smile indicates</seg>
<seg id="3">that he thinks that America is with his government, but perhaps he forgot that these are the same people who were with Parvez Musharraf a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">This picture was taken as if it is a family portrait.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was no such picture, a President with three American officials published in the newspapers earlier.</seg>
<seg id="6">It seems the work for America in Pakistan has increased and they want more than one person to finish it, or they do not trust this slave more than they believed the earlier one.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also possible that Zardari's promise-breaking stories have reached them, and so they made an allowance for that.</seg>
<seg id="8">A sincere ruler would not have shown his teeth in the picture, and he would at least have a little shame on his face for being a slave.</seg>
<seg id="9">If one applies the rules of democracy to this picture, Zardari is in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a democracy, majority rules the country. And who is a majority? The picture speaks a lot about it.</seg>

<seg id="1">One year of army action has passed in the disturbed border province of Swat, and the situation is going from bad to worse.</seg>
<seg id="2">On the one hand, the government is limited in this area to repeating to move a condemnation writ in the national assembly, and on the other hand, Taliban's illegal FM Radio is enjoying immense popularity in Swat.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thirdly, common citizens find it fit to obey the one who is practically in charge of this area.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Swat, during the operations of security forces, they claimed to kill ..... fundamentals through their gunship helicopters and cannons, but despite these killings, the Taliban is not only becoming stronger but, according to an estimate, are practically ruling eighty percent of Swat.</seg>
<seg id="5">The result is, while the government is not ready to accept its defeat, the Taliban is well established there.</seg>
<seg id="6">Who is caught between the line of fire? Poor citizens.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Swat, it is now said, someone asked what kind of people are Taliban. Another answered, very good, because they are the custodians of religion and fight against the 'enemies of Allah and religion.'</seg>
<seg id="8">Again asked, how is the army? Someone answered, very good because they 'defend the country and fight against the enemies of the country.'</seg>
<seg id="9">Then again asked, who are the enemies of religion and the country? Then came the answer: we, the citizens of this country'.</seg>

<seg id="1">Heavenly Swat is called the Switzerland of Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2">As per the government's strategy, talks are in progress at the same time force is also being used.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the use of force is only increasing the power of the Taliban; there is a sympathy among the people for them, but there is no benefit beyond it.</seg>
<seg id="4">The need of the hour is to use no force, but to finish the root cause of it.</seg>
<seg id="5">If the root cause is ended, people like Fazlullah and the Taliban will be finished on their own.</seg>
<seg id="6">The proposed Sharia Bill by ANP will solve the problems of Swat to a large extent.</seg>

<seg id="1">The initial steps taken by General Musharraf started to give one a feeling that the nation will now get rid of these inefficient politicians, but his greed for power has changed all of his aspirations.</seg>
<seg id="2">He started to think of himself as invincible after joining "The War On Terror," doing whatever was expected.</seg>
<seg id="3">And the measures that were expected, shattered.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Bush's tenure came to an end, he also became worried about the end of his government and quickly dealt with thieves.</seg>
<seg id="5">Even after that, General Musharraf could have controlled the army, but who knows what is happening with the present government?</seg>
<seg id="6">Whether it is Bajod or Swat, the government is not controlling terror, but rather bombarding its "enemies"; this not only damages property, but also makes the "enemy" a mental patient. Then, only we are their enemies.</seg>

<seg id="2">They could not even track the illegally operated Taliban FM channel, which I believe is easy to track.</seg>
<seg id="3">Even now, this FM channel is spitting fire with great fanfare.</seg>
<seg id="4">Boys' schools are being destroyed after closing down girls' schools.</seg>
<seg id="5">A curfew is imposed so that Talibans can move easily from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tonight, eight trucks barged into Mengura during curfew hours and created a front overnight.</seg>
<seg id="7">The question is, how did they reach there during curfew?</seg>
<seg id="8">The Army can kill Akbar Bagti in his house, and salutes the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Allah's sake, somebody make this army understand to remove the innocent people of Swat and prove that the Pakistan Army can beat any enemy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatahu,</seg>
<seg id="2">Today, after Isha prayers, when I was coming towards my shop, a man who was sitting in a vehicle raised his hand and summoned me.</seg>
<seg id="3">I thought this man has forgotten his way or wanted to ask something. I stopped, and when I looked into the car, his whole family was in it.</seg>
<seg id="4">He asked me if I understand Arabic well. I said, no problem; tell me what is the matter.</seg>
<seg id="5">He started saying, "I came from Riyaz to Madinah but someone picked my pocket. Please help me." I asked for an excuse because one such incident had happened to me even earlier. I gave that man a note of 20 Riyals to get the gasoline to go back to Riyaz, but after going a little ahead he started to do it again.</seg>
<seg id="6">I got very angry- I shouted at him and threatened to call the police. Then he ran away.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is the situation of us Muslims- we come with our families in cars to beg and earn at least two to three thousand a day.</seg>
<seg id="8">While there is a clear Hadith (PBUH), the upper hand is better than the underhand, and the upper hand is the hand of the giver.</seg>
