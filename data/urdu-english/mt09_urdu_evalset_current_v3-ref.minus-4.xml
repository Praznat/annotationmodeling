<seg id="1">Support of France's Recommendation</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">The Committee meeting was held in Parliament House on Friday under the direction of Committee Chairman Mushahid Hussain Sayed, wherein it was recommended to the government that, in addition to sending relief supplies, it should also send a parliamentary delegation of the representatives of all political parties to Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">After the meeting, Mushahid Hussain Sayed, while talking to the representative of the media, said the Committee has welcomed France's recommendation that Israel immediately call a ceasefire and permit relief activities for victims in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="4">Declaring Israel's attack on Palestinians a crime against humanity, he said that all countries should condemn these attacks.</seg>
<seg id="5">Targeting his criticism against their double standard, Mushahid Hussain questioned the silence of those who speak out against terrorism about Israel's attacks on Palestinians.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs also criticized the apathetic behavior of Muslim leaders on the problem in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that the committee is hopeful that the newly elected American president Barack Obama will address the Muslim world during his first 100 days in office so that the gulf between America and the Muslim world can be bridged.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mushahid Hussain Sayed said that, not only should emergency steps be taken to fill the gap between the Muslim world and the West, but also old problems like those of Kashmir and Palestine should also be solved.</seg>
<seg id="9">Malik Amad Khan, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, told the Committee that he is going to Saudi Arabia to attend the meeting of foreign ministers for the Organization of Islamic Countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">This emergency meeting has been called as a result of Israel's attacks on Palestine. He said that the government is aware of the Palestine issue and is in contact with the leaders of other countries about it.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the problem of Palestine should be solved according to the resolutions of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="12">Two journalists from Arab countries also participated in the meeting and reported the current situation in Palestine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Avoiding Dieting Can Prevent Flu</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">This finding by American scientists has emerged as a result of experiments performed on rats.</seg>
<seg id="3">The experiments proved that the ability to combat the flu virus was lower in rats who were kept on a low-calorie diet.</seg>
<seg id="4">This research has proven wrong the old saying that "while suffering from fever, it is better to abstain from eating."</seg>
<seg id="5">According to scientists, it is better to eat and drink a lot during a fever.</seg>
<seg id="6">Researchers from Michigan State University say that rats on a low diet were found to have less ability to fight off infection and an increased chance of mortality, while rats on a normal diet had greater resistance against the flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Professor Elizabeth Gardner, people on a diet will not only succumb quickly to the flu, but will also take longer to recover.</seg>
<seg id="8">She also says that even people who have taken the flu vaccine should avoid dieting during the winter months.</seg>

<seg id="1">First Nuclear Test Done in 1990</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Thomas Reed, who has worked as a weapon designer in America's Liver National Laboratory, wrote this book in cooperation with Danny Stillman, former Director of Technical Intelligence at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the book, entitled "Nuclear Express: The Political History and Spread of the Bomb," both writers have claimed that any country that has made an atomic bomb has either stolen nuclear secrets from another country or has done so with the support of another nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="4">During one of the interviews with US News, Thomas Reed said that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb in 1990, during the time of Benazir Bhutto.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that his belief that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb is based on several reasons,</seg>
<seg id="6">including the design of the bomb and information collected from conversations with Chinese scientists.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that this is why Pakistan was able to respond in 1998 to India's nuclear test with their own test only two weeks and three days later.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thomas Reed reminded the interviewer how, when Russia conducted a nuclear test in 1961, America responded with its own test only 17 days later, despite the fact that it had had the bomb for quite some time.</seg>
<seg id="9">He added that the nuclear bomb, which Pakistan tested in May 1998, was very carefully made and Pakistani scientists had full confidence in it.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Thomas Reed was asked why China would provide Pakistan with nuclear technology, he responded that it is because India is a common enemy to both Pakistan and China.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that there is evidence that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan used the Chinese design, and that this was later verified through documents acquired from Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">When asked whether it is common for countries to collaborate in nuclear testing, he gave the example of how America expressly conducted a nuclear test for Britain in 1990 in the Nevada desert.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said they also speculate that Israel was provided access to the results of this test.</seg>
<seg id="14">Reed was also asked whether China has plans for continued nuclear expansion.</seg>
<seg id="15">He responded that China has been providing raw materials, guidelines, and designs for nuclear installation in the Iranian city of Isfahan since 1991,</seg>
<seg id="16">and has provided Iran with a production plant in Karaj.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen through North Korea.</seg>

<seg id="1">2008: A Great Year for Madonna</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">The show was based on Madonna's album "Hard Candy" and featured a band of Ukrainian gypsies, or nomads, as well as a duet with Justin Timberlake.</seg>
<seg id="3">An old racing car was also placed onstage.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was the most profitable show since that of Celine Dion in 2008, bringing in $236.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="5">While the Canadian show "Taking Chances" visited twenty-four countries, Madonna went to only seventeen countries as part of her first world tour in the last eight years.</seg>
<seg id="6">Both singers' shows were directed by Jamie King, who had also organized the Spice Girls' "Reunion" tour.</seg>
<seg id="7">Madonna broke her own previous record set in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2006, she had earned $193.7 million from the "Confession" concerts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Pollster declared Bon Jovi to be the third most successful singer, earning $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bruce Springsteen came in fourth, earning $166 million, and the Police in fifth, with $120.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to Pollster, very few people attended concerts and vocal performances in North America in 2008; only those who were able to buy the expensive tickets.</seg>
<seg id="12">In America, the average ticket price increased by eight percent, and the highest-priced ticket for Madonna's show sold for $350.</seg>
<seg id="13">Pollster's editor Gary Bongiovanni said that, taking into account the global economic slump, 2008 proved to be a good year for singers.</seg>
<seg id="14">He has predicted that 2009 will be a good year for U2 and Springsteen, whose albums are soon to be released.</seg>

</hl>
<seg id="2">Local Taliban members of the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group have distributed a pamphlet in Miranshah, the capital of North Waziristan, and in other tehsils in which a threat has been made against government and semi-government educational institutions where boys and girls are provided with co-education.</seg>
<seg id="3">The pamphlet states that if co-ed institutions are not shut down by January 5, then action will be taken against them.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also states that identity cards may not be issued to women for government assistance or any other educational purposes, and women are forbidden to go to the NADRA offices in all tehsils.</seg>
<seg id="5">This announcement forbidding the issuance of identity cards has been made at a time when approximately 200 women have submitted application forms at the NADRA offices to have their identity cards issued for the Benazir Income Support Program in North Waziristan.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the local people, the Taliban's pamphlet was read over the loudspeakers of all mosques in North Waziristan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Nevertheless, it was not stated in writing whether separate educational institutions for girls will be banned or not.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the pamphlet, if any woman is caught trying to get an education from school or her identity card from a NADRA office after this announcement, she and her family will be punished by religious law.</seg>

<seg id="10">On Saturday, Muslim Khan, spokesperson of local Taliban members in Swat, told BBC that three dead bodies among those found on Friday were of his associates, including Devlai's Taliban Commander Rafiullah.</seg>
<seg id="11">Muslim Khan said that Rafiullah was in the custody of security forces for the past month and a half.</seg>
<seg id="12">He said that local Taliban members issue a notice prior to killing someone; on the other hand, the general public has serious concern over these continued incidents in Mingora.</seg>
<seg id="13">Local people say that a large number of security forces have been deployed in Mingora, but despite that, there are increasing attacks on civilians.</seg>

<seg id="1">Protest Against Firing of Journalists</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">On Tuesday in Islamabad, in front of the Islamabad Press Club, under arrangements by the journalists' organization "RIUJ," journalists and newspaper workers protested and shouted slogans against the owners of mass media and the government for the firing of a great number of employees from TV channels and newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="3">When speaking to the demonstrators, C. R. Shamsi - senior member of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, the largest organization of journalists - said that the politicians who used to protest with them on the streets are now sitting in the government as rulers, but are doing nothing for the rights of journalists out of fear of a specific group of newspaper owners.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said that the owners of newspaper who talk about human rights have made their organizations into torture chambers and beggar camps where they pay the workers extremely low wages and financially murder hundreds by firing them, despite earning billions of rupees each year for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="5">The example before us is that of a worker of private TV Channel Five in Lahore who had committed suicide after not being paid for four months; even today, many workers are living under duress due to forced dismissal and not receiving their salaries for months.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that direct steps should be taken against TV and newspaper owners and a permanent protest camp needs to be set up before the Parliament for the rights of journalists.</seg>
<seg id="7">C. R. Shamsi, criticizing Governor of Punjab Salman Taseer, said that employees are being dismissed from his Urdu newspaper "Aaj Kal" without any notice.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Daily Jinnah, Daily Khabrein, Channel Five, Business Plus TV, and Aaj TV have fired dozens of employees,</seg>
<seg id="9">Mazhar Abbas, Secretary General of PUFJ, said, when speaking to demonstrators, that today, throughout the country, journalist organizations are celebrating Black Day against the firing of journalists and newspaper workers, while the journalists will go to the Parliament session to fight for their rights with black bands tied on their arms.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Mazhar Abbas, the workers and journalists are being exploited in eighty-five percent of Pakistan's newspapers and TV channels, where they are working without any contract.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that until now, more than 200 journalists and workers have been dismissed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is feared that during the current year, owners will dismiss hundreds more, justifying this on the basis of the economic crisis.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mazhar Abbas said that the journalists' movement will continue until the workers who were fired are reinstated, the Seventh Wage Board Award that fixes the wages of newspaper workers is implemented, and the salaries of workers of TV channels and newspapers are paid, which have been withheld for months.</seg>

<seg id="6">Meanwhile, Omar Abdullah, the Chief Minister appointed by the coalition government, met with the Governor and gave him official notification of his selection as the leader of the Assembly by his party, the National Conference.</seg>
<seg id="7">National Conference's supportive party Congress also informed the Governor of its support for Omar Abdullah.</seg>
<seg id="8">Omar Abdullah will be given the oath as Chief Minister of State tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="9">It should be noted that in the recent state elections, National Conference, after winning 28 seats in the 87-member House, has emerged as the largest party. Separatist parties had boycotted the elections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Role of European Union for Peace in Middle East</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">When viewed from an official standpoint, the role of the European Union in the conciliatory efforts to stop the war in the Middle East is decisive.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the official stand of Brussels, Schwarzenberg's delegation or Sarkozy's efforts are the equivalent to lending a helping hand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Amadeu Altafaj, spokesperson for the European Commission, said that every effort by which the European Commission's concerted message can be sent to warring parties is praiseworthy.</seg>
<seg id="5">As far as its official statement is concerned, everything looks fine.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in reality the European Union is presenting a sad picture of its own internal tug-of-war.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Union President, the role of the Czech Republic has already been weak.</seg>
<seg id="8">On top of that, internal disputes have rendered it helpless.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the other hand, French President Sarkozy is acting as though he is still performing the presidential duties of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even though France has completed its six-month presidential term.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sarkozy wants to play a leadership role, and he is certainly capable, but he does not have the permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="12">French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner is faced with the most ludicrous situation.</seg>
<seg id="13">He is included in the delegation led by Czech Republic's Foreign Minister Schwarzenberg.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, both Foreign Ministers are making different statements about the war in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend itself, while Kouchner thinks that this war cannot be called one of self-defense. Meanwhile Germany has also sent its own special envoy to the Middle East. Until the European Union demonstrates harmony by taking a united stand, it cannot achieve success on the diplomatic front.</seg>
<seg id="16">Evidence of this is Israel's conduct, which does not show any respect for Europe's conciliatory efforts.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is a golden opportunity for the European Union to do something because America has failed in the Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush.</seg>

<seg id="1">Financial Crisis: Billionaire German Industrialist's Suicide</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Adolf Merckle of Southern Germany's Swabia area has left a large business group behind,</seg>
<seg id="3">but until some time ago the average German citizen did not know much about him.</seg>
<seg id="4">When he had to carry on negotiations for several weeks with the nearly thirty banks who lend money to his industrial group, he became the topic of headlines and began to see the future of the Merckle group as bleak.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Merckle group was forced to suffer millions of euros in losses due to the financial crisis, after purchasing shares of the German Volkswagen manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="6">So when financial institutions refused to make new loans of between 700 million and one billion euros to this group, which they desperately needed, Merckle came under intense pressure.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just recently the same banks had agreed to provide loans to the Merckle group on an emergency basis, but Adolf Merckle, who had moved from being a small industrialist to the position that his industrial group's annual income was approximately 30 billion euros, could not withstand the deprivation of his strength as a capitalist.</seg>
<seg id="8">When Adolf Merckle took charge of his family's business after the death of his father, he greatly improved the business very quickly through a process of modernization.</seg>
<seg id="9">He named his company "Ratiopharm," now the biggest and most successful pharmaceutical company in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until recently the company was worth between 5 and 6 billion euros, and it still generates an annual income of 8.1 billion euros. After the tremendous success of Ratiopharm, the Merckle group purchased several large institutions, including HeidelbergCement, a manufacturer of construction materials, and Kaessbohrer, a manufacturer of special vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="11">The number of Merckle Group employees worldwide is nearly 100,000, and the Ratiopharm pharmaceutical company has always held a special place amongst its assets.</seg>
<seg id="12">In his life Adolf Merckle had said on several occasions, "This is our fourth generation of drug manufacturers.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now this company's administration is with my children and I am hopeful that in the coming few hundred years it will remain under my family's administration."</seg>
<seg id="14">After the suicide of Adolf Merckle, banks approved a temporary loan of 400 million euros to his VEM group, but on the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that the group's financial situation can be improved over the long term.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thus after the death of Adolf Merckle, the Merckle group will not be the same as it used to be.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to recent statistics, between 2004 and 2007 the crime rate of foreigners</seg>
<seg id="3">decreased from 22.9 percent</seg>
<seg id="4">to 21.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Joachim Herrmann, Interior Minister of the Bavarian Province, this only appears to be a positive change.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said, "It is necessary to keep in mind that the number of foreigners obtaining German citizenship is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Therefore, when presenting the statistics, this fact should also be made clear that even when the criminal is a German citizen, his background may be foreign.</seg>
<seg id="8">Herrmann said that in 2010 his province will take this into account when collecting data about criminals.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition to Bavaria, thinking is being done along the same lines in the province of Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="10">CDU's Senator of Internal Affairs Christoph Ahlhaus said, "When research is conducted in a scientific manner, one cannot draw up the results he would like to see ahead of time; they must depend on the data that emerges from the research.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ahlhaus directed attention towards an analytical report from the provincial office of crime prevention prepared in 2006 in which the percentage of foreigners' involvement in crime was studied in the Bergedorf borough of the city of Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="12">Results showed that here</seg>
<seg id="13">the rate of crimes committed by foreigners is less than the crime rate for the entire province.</seg>
<seg id="14">In contrast, when the crime rate amongst adolescents was studied in 2006 in Berlin, it was seen that the rate of adolescents with foreign background was</seg>
<seg id="15">44.7 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, other German political parties, such as SPD, the environmentalist party Garbanz, and the left-wing party Linkspartei, are opposed to the idea of determining which German citizens have foreign background when gathering crime data.</seg>

<seg id="2">In this thirty-minute video a person wearing a black turban, covering his face and carrying a gun in his hand, is sending a message to the German government.</seg>
<seg id="3">The man introduces himself with the name Abu Talha and speaks in German.</seg>
<seg id="4">The video message also has Arabic subtitles.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Al Qaeda logo appears on the side of the screen, and the video is dated October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the message it is stated to the German government that if, by stationing military in such large numbers in Afghanistan, their country means to express its belief that it will not be attacked, what could be more naïve?</seg>
<seg id="7">The person calling himself Abu Talha did not threaten to attack Germany directly, however.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently the number of German troops included in the united NATO army in Afghanistan is approximately 3,500.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, in October, the German Parliament approved a decision to send 1,000 more troops to Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the first message received by Germany from Al Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id="11">Regarding the message, Mikhail Lüders, a distinguished expert on matters of terrorism, says, "The recent suicide attack outside the German Embassy in Kabul is evidence that we should take this very seriously."</seg>
<seg id="12">For the past few years Al Qaeda has been sending video messages on the internet, and these kinds of messages have been followed by attacks.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Saturday, the militant Taliban organization claimed responsibility for the suicide attack outside the German Embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="14">Most German newspapers and advisors consider this attack to be related to the Al Qaeda message.</seg>
<seg id="15">"They are making Germany a target."</seg>
<seg id="16">Fundamentalist Muslims have a negative and critical view of Germany's Afghan policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">They accuse the German government of adopting biased policies, not only in Afghanistan, but in the Middle East as well.</seg>
<seg id="18">And for this reason they very much consider Germany to be their target.</seg>

<seg id="4">This research conducted in the American state of Florida's Moffitt Cancer Center has found that for women less than 50 years of age, the risk of breast cancer tumors</seg>

<seg id="6">Research has also found that drinking three or more cups of tea daily does not hold any particular benefit in this respect for elderly women.</seg>
<seg id="7">Experts think that the reason for this is the presence in tea of some ingredients that are more effective against those particular cancerous tumors that most commonly occur in women under fifty years of age.</seg>
<seg id="8">In Florida state's Moffitt Cancer Center in the city of Tampa, this research was conducted on more than 5,000 women who had been treated for breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Experts compared their medical records and lifestyles to women who did not have breast cancer.</seg>

<seg id="2">New Research</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="3">Exercise is good for the health at every age.</seg>
<seg id="4">It makes your heart stronger, lowers cholesterol levels, helps in keeping weight low, helps prevent diabetes, and slows down the progress of Alzheimer's or senility.</seg>
<seg id="5">Unfortunately, in many people the ability to exercise decreases as age increases.</seg>
<seg id="6">Experts say that exercise keeps our body and mind alert, although age can have an effect on this.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American Medical Association says that not exercising can lead to several health problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">Dr. Patricia Pellikka of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says that increased age is a big reason behind an inability to exercise and a decrease in the body's performance.</seg>
<seg id="9">Doctor Patricia teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.</seg>
<seg id="10">She headed a study about heart disease and the ability of humans to exercise in old age.</seg>
<seg id="11">A team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to examine the performance of the heart</seg>
<seg id="12">in which the heart's pumping of blood, its phases of contraction and relaxation, was observed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Experts have focused their attention on the left side of the heart, the side which pumps the blood.</seg>
<seg id="14">They found that an increase in age is accompanied by an increase in problems in the relaxation phase of the heart.</seg>
<seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says that with increased age the problems in the relaxation phase of the heart become prominent and their effect on the ability to exercise gets worse.</seg>
<seg id="16">Dr. Garvan Kane was a part of this study.</seg>
<seg id="17">He says that "we were surprised to see that this thing has a compulsory effect, which explained how much a poor performance in exercise can be related to the relaxation phase of the heart."</seg>
<seg id="18">Many times blood pressure can become a cause for problems in the functioning of the heart and heart diseases.</seg>

<seg id="1">Even if the ongoing dialogue between Pakistan and India has been disturbed after the Mumbai attacks, both countries should continue the dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="2">If they think of going to war, then both sides will lose human lives.</seg>
<seg id="3">India says that the person they arrested for the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani national and he had also sent a letter in Urdu to Pakistan. However, it is significant to note that initially, when Indian authorities arrested this extremist, they claimed that he was an accomplished engineer, but later they said that his education was only at the fourth grade level, something to be determined.</seg>

<seg id="2">This is also evident from American history.</seg>
<seg id="3">And in the case of an Indian attack, America will achieve its goals while India will foot the bill.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pakistan should make it clear that we would not initiate war, but if an invasion takes place, then discussion of treaty, peace, and ceasefire will not take place until India is completely destroyed or occupied, even if this means our own destruction.</seg>

This is why, after the initial strong international reaction, now the world has reduced its pressure on Pakistan.</seg>

<seg id="7">I studied biology with difficulty for a month, but when I couldn't make heads or tails of it, I changed the subject and took math instead.</seg>
<seg id="8">It means the dread of physical labor made me an engineer and now I have a better job than most of my peers in the family, for which I constantly thank God.</seg>

<seg id="3">No, absolutely not. Sir, religion is what teaches us that there is no black or white, no Punjabi or Muhajir. If there were no religion, half the world would have been destroyed in the battle between blacks and whites and the rest in the animosity between races.</seg>

</hl>
<seg id="2">This research of American scientists has come to light after experiments done on mice.</seg>
<seg id="3">The experiments have proved that the capability of fighting Flu virus became less in mice placed on food containing fewer calories.</seg>
<seg id="4">The old saying that,'It's better to starve during fever,'has been proven wrong by the research.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the scientists,eat well during fever.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the researchers of Michigan State University, the fighting capability against infections in mice that were placed on a diet was found meagre and the chances of their death increased, while the mice placed on regular food had a very high immunity against flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Professor Elizabeth Gardner, people on a diet will not only be affected very quickly by the flu,it will also take more time for them to recuperate.</seg>
<seg id="8">She also says that even those people who have taken the flu vaccine should avoid dieting during the few months of winter.</seg>

<seg id="1">"First Nuclear Experiment conducted in 1990"</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Thomas Reed, who has worked as a weapon designer in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory of America, has written this book in collaboration with Danny Stillman,the former Director of Technical Intelligence of Los Alamos National Laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="3">This book has been written with the title 'Nuclear Express:A Political History of the Bomb And its Proliferation,' and in this both the authors have claimed that any country that has made an atomic bomb has either stolen the nuclear secrets of another country or has had cooperation with some other nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thomas Reed said in an interview to US News that in 1990, in the era of Benazir Bhutto, China had conducted the experiment of Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas Reed said that he is convinced on the basis of several reasons that China has conducted the experiment of Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those reasons include the design of the bomb and information obtained while talking to the scientists of China.</seg>
<seg id="7">He further said that this was the reason why in 1998, Pakistan was able to conduct a nuclear experiment just in two weeks and three days in response to India's nuclear experiment.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thomas Reed also reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and it took 17 days for America to do the experiment in response to this, although America already had this bomb for awhile.</seg>
<seg id="9">He further said that the atom bomb, whose experiment was done in 1998 by Pakistan, was developed with extreme care and Pakistani scientists had full confidence in it.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Thomas Reed was asked if China had provided the nuclear technology to Pakistan, he replied that India was a common enemy of China and Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that the proof to this also exists in that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and, apart from this, the documents retrieved from Libya afterwards also proved this.</seg>
<seg id="12">To another question as to whether it is usual to carry out nuclear experiments with others, he said that in 1990 America openly conducted a nuclear experiment for Britain in the desert of Nevada.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said that we may also presume that Israel, too, was given access to the results of this experiment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thomas Reed was also asked whether China's nuclear proliferation program is active.</seg>
<seg id="15">On this, Thomas Reid said that since 1991, China has been providing raw material, instructions, and designs for the nuclear structure situated in Ispahan, a city in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="16">Besides this, China has also provided an enrichment plant to Iran in Karaj.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen through North Korea.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Tuesday in front of Islamabad Press Club, journalists and newspaper workers rallied and raised slogans in a protest organized by the organization of the journalists of Islamabad 'RIUJ' against media owners and the government on the sacking of a large number of employees from TV channels and newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Addressing the demonstrators, the senior member of the largest organization of the journalists, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, C. R. Shamsi, said that those politicians who were protesting with us on the streets lately, have now become rulers and are sitting in the parliament; however, they are not doing any good for the rights of journalists, as they are afraid of a specific group of newspaper owners.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said that the newspaper owners, who talk about human rights, have turned their organizations into torture cells and labor camps, where, despite making billions of rupees, they are committing financial murder on workers by paying them extremely low wages and sacking them from the employment.</seg>
<seg id="5">In front of us, the example of this is that of a worker of a private TV channel FIVE who committed suicide after not getting the salary for four months, and even today, many workers are living miserably because of forced dismissals and not getting salaries for months.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that direct action should be taken against TV and newspaper owners, and for the rights of journalists, a protest camp is needed on a permanent basis in front of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="7">Criticizing the Governor of the Punjab Salman Taseer, C. R. Shamsi said that the employees are being sacked without any notice from his Urdu newspaper 'Aaj Kal',</seg>
<seg id="8">whereas Daily Jinnah, Daily Khabrain, Channel Five, Business Plus TV, and Aaj TV have also dismissed dozens of employees.</seg>
<seg id="9">Addressing the protestors, the Secretary General of PUFJ, Mazhar Abbas, said that today the journalist organizations are observing Black Day countrywide against the sacking of journalists and newspaper workers, whereas the journalist will go to the session of the parliament with black bands on their arms for the achievement of their rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Mazhar Abbas, in 85% of the newspapers and TV channels, workers and journalists are being exploited where they are working without any contract.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that as of now, more than 200 journalists and workers are being dismissed from the newspapers and TV channels, and it is feared that in the current year, the owners will dismiss hundreds of workers on the justification of financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mazhar Abbas said that the journalists movement will continue until the dismissed workers are reinstated, the 7th Wage Board Award, which assesses the wages of newspaper workers, is implemented, and TV channels and newspaper workers are paid their unpaid salaries for many months.</seg>

<seg id="1">European Union's Role in Middle East Peace</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">If seen from the official perspective, the European Union's role in reconciliation efforts to stop the Middle East war is decisive.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the Brussels government stand, efforts of the Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy's are synonymous to help in this task.</seg>
<seg id="4">The spokesman of the European Commission Amadeu Altafaj said that all such efforts through which sending a joint message to the warring parties from the European Union could be helpful, are worthy of praise.</seg>
<seg id="5">Everything looks fine from the perspective of the official statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, in reality, the European Union is presenting a regretful picture of the internal tug of war.</seg>
<seg id="7">The role of the Czech Republic as the President of the Union is already weak.</seg>
<seg id="8">On top of this, the internal wrangling has made it helpless.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the other hand, the French President Sarkozy is acting like he is still discharging the duties as the president of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although France has already completed its six-month presidential tenure.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sarkozy wants to play the lead role and he can do it; but he is not permitted for this.</seg>
<seg id="12">The most embarrassing situation is being faced by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner.</seg>
<seg id="13">He is in the delegation which is headed by the Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic, Schwarzenberg.</seg>
<seg id="14">And on top of this, both foreign ministers are giving different statements about the Middle East war.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kouchner says that Israel has a right of self-defense, while according to Schwarzenberg, this war does not come under self defense. In the meantime, Germany has also sent its special envoy to the Middle East. Until the European Union shows harmony based on similar point of views, it cannot succeed on the diplomatic front.</seg>
<seg id="16">The proof of this is the attitude of Israel, which does not give any importance to the reconciliation efforts of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is the golden opportunity for the European Union to accomplish something, as America has already failed in the Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush.</seg>

<seg id="1">Economic Crisis: Billionaire German Industrialist Commits Suicide</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Although Adolf Merckle, a resident of the area of Swabia of South Germany, has left a huge business group after him.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the common German citizens did not know much about him up until a little while ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">Then, when he had to negotiate with about 30 banks for many weeks which provided loans to his business group, he became the subject of the headlines, and the future of Merckle Group also looked to bleak him.</seg>
<seg id="5">Merckle Group also had to bear a loss of hundreds of millions of Euros due to the financial crisis after buying shares of German car manufacturing company Volkswagen.</seg>
<seg id="6">And when the financial institutions denied the new loans, valued at between 700 million and one-billion Euros, mandatorily needed by this group, Merckle came under severe stress.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sometime back, these very banks had agreed to provide loans to Merckle Group on an emergency basis; however, Adolf Merckle, who had risen to such heights from a small industrialist that his group's income had become around 30 billion Euros, could not bear the loss of his investment power.</seg>
<seg id="8">When Adolf Merckle took charge of his family business after the death of his father, he managed it on the modern lines and gave it a tremendous boost.</seg>
<seg id="9">He named his company Ratiopharm, which is an extremely successful and very large pharmaceutical firm of Germany today.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until sometime ago, the business worth of this pharmaceutical firm was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and even now it earns 1.8 billion Euros annually. After the huge success of Ratiopharm, Merckle Group purchased many large firms, which included a company named Heidelberg Cement manufacturing construction materials to the company named Kaessbohrer, which manufactures a special type of vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="11">The number of the employees of Merckle Group around the globe is one-hundred thousand and in its assets, Ratiopharm, the drug manufacturing company, has always held special importance.</seg>
<seg id="12">Adolf Merckle had said this many times in his life: "We have been manufacturing drugs for four generations.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now the management of this firm is in the hands of my children and I hope that this firm will still remain under my family's management for a few hundred years.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the suicide of Adolf Merckle, banks have approved interim loans worth 400 million Euros for his group VEM, but on the condition that VEM has to sell Ratiopharm so that the financial condition of this group could be improved on a long-term basis.</seg>
<seg id="15">This way, after the death of Adolf Merckle, the Merckle Group would not remain the same like it used to be.</seg>

<seg id="1">Crime Rate among Foreigners in Germany</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">According to the latest statistics, the crime rate among foreigners between 2004 and 2007</seg>
<seg id="3">has reduced from 22.9 percent</seg>
<seg id="4">to 21.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Joachim Herrmann, the Interior Minister of Bavaria Province, this is apparently a mere positive change.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said: "It should be kept in mind that the number of foreigners seeking German nationality is increasing."</seg>
<seg id="7">Therefore, this fact should also be mentioned in the statistics that although the person who commits a crime is a German, he/she also has a foreign background.</seg>
<seg id="8">Herrmann said that from 2010, his province will keep this fact in mind while collecting statistics about criminals.</seg>
<seg id="9">Besides Bavaria, the province of Hamburg is also thinking on the same lines.</seg>
<seg id="10">Senator for Interior Affairs Christoph Ahlhaus of CDU said: "When investigations are done according to the scientific method, a person cannot compile results beforehand as per his/her own will, instead the results depend on the statistics which come after the investigations have been completed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Ahlhaus drew attention to an analytical report of a provincial crime control office, which was prepared in 2006, and according to which it was investigated that in Bergdorf, a part of the city of Hamburg, what percentage of the foreigners is involved in the crimes taking place there.</seg>
<seg id="12">The results have shown that here foreigners'</seg>
<seg id="13">rate of crime is lower as compared to the crimes taking place in the whole province.</seg>
<seg id="14">Contrary to this, when in Berlin, in 2006 the rate of crime in youngsters was reviewed, it was found that the percentage of youngsters having foreign background was 44</seg>
<seg id="15">.7 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the other political parties of Germany, for example Linkspartei, the party of environmentalists, Greens and the leftist party, SPD, are against this proposal that, while collecting statistics related to crimes, this information should also be collected in which German citizens have a foreign background.</seg>

</hl>
<seg id="2">In this video of 30 minutes' duration, one person, wearing a black turban, mask on the face and holding a gun in his hand is giving a message to the German government.</seg>
<seg id="3">This person is introducing himself with the name Abu Talha and is conversing in German language.</seg>
<seg id="4">This video message also has Arabic subtitles.</seg>
<seg id="5">Al Qaeda's logo appears on the side of the screen and the video has the date of October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this message, this has been conveyed to the German government that if they were exhibiting confidence that they would not be attacked due to deployment of such a huge army in Afghanistan, they are sadly mistaken and ignorant.</seg>
<seg id="7">This person, calling himself Abu Talha, has however, not given a threat to Germany of direct attacks.</seg>
<seg id="8">The number of German soldiers in the NATO coalition army, deployed at this time in Afghanistan, is around three-thousand, five-hundred.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year in October, the German parliament approved a bill sending 1000 more soldiers to Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the first message from Al Qaeda to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="11">Prominent expert having insight in affairs pertaining to terrorism, Michael Luders says with reference to this message: " The recent suicidal attack outside the German Embassy in Kabul is a testimony that we should take it seriously under any circumstance.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the last few years, Al Qaeda has been issuing video messages on the Internet, and there have also been attacks after such messages.</seg>
<seg id="13">The militant organization the Taliban has taken responsibility of the suicidal attack that occurred on Saturday outside the German Embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="14">Most of the German newspapers and observers are looking at this attack together with Al Qaeda's message.</seg>
<seg id="15">"They are targeting Germany</seg>
<seg id="16">The fundamentalist Muslims see Germany's Afghan policy with critical eyes and as negative.</seg>
<seg id="17">They blame the German government for adopting discriminatory policies not only in Afghanistan, but also in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="18">And because of this reason, they are taking Germany more and more as their target.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the meantime, the German Government says that the German intelligence agency already knew about this video, even before it became public.</seg>
<seg id="20">A German federal crimes control agency is busy examining this video.</seg>

<seg id="3">Now when Obama is getting felicitation messages from the whole world on becoming the President of America, the expectations associated with him are also coming forth.</seg>

<seg id="7">Although the policies of the former American President George W. Bush have always been criticized,</seg>
<seg id="8">nonetheless, his administration is definitely praised for encouraging China to play a more constructive role at the international level, whereas China has said about the new American president that he has to work for a strong military relationship between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">An active Chinese political expert in the German city Bochum, Goo Sui Woo, says</seg>
<seg id="10">"In this perspective, I am sure that in the coming weeks and months, Obama and his financial team will exert extreme pressure to force the Beijing government to adopt a flexible and market-compatible exchange rate for the Chinese currency.</seg>
<seg id="11">The former American administration has also furthered its relationship with India.</seg>

<seg id="6">In the research, it was also said that the women of higher age don't get any noticeable benefits in this regard by taking three or more cups of tea daily.</seg>
<seg id="7">The experts say that the reason of this is the presence of some elements in the tea that are effective against those tumors which occur in the women of less than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="8">This research was done on more than five-thousand women who were treated for breast cancer in the Moffitt Cancer Center, situated in the city of Tampa in the state of Florida.</seg>

<seg id="10">The experts compared their medical records and their lifestyle with those of the women who were safe from breast cancer.</seg>

<seg id="12">Every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type.</seg>

<seg id="2">If they will talk about war, then there will be loss of human lives on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="3">India says that the person caught in the Mumbai attacks is from Pakistan, and he has also written and sent a letter to Pakistan in Urdu, but on the other hand, when India got hold of this extremist, they said that he is a highly-qualified engineer, but later on, they said that he is educated only up to four class. This is strange.</seg>

<seg id="2">This is the old history of America.</seg>
<seg id="3">Whereas in the case of the Indian attacks, America will achieve its objectives, and that, too, at the Indian cost.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pakistan should clearly announce that we will not be the first to attack, but in case of aggression, the talks for peace, reconciliations and ceasefire will take place only when we have either completely destroyed India or have occupied it, no matter if we ourselves get completely destroyed.</seg>

<seg id="2">Indian efforts in seeking compensation for the Mumbai attacks in terms of extraordinary diplomatic and military benefits indicate that it is crying more than it was originally affected that is why contrary to initial strong international reaction, the world has now released pressure on Pakistan.</seg>

<seg id="4">In fact, religion provides moral training to human beings and makes them disciplined on the grounds that they have not been born with their own free will, but the Creator of the universe has sent them here and they have to live in this world in accordance with God's commands.</seg>

<seg id="1">'First Nuclear Test, Carried Out in 1990'</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Thomas Reed, who has worked as Weapons Designer at America's Lever National Laboratory, wrote this book in coordination with former Director of Technical Intelligence at the Alamos National Laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="3">This book has been written under the title, 'The Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation' and both the writers have claimed in it that every country that has made the atom bomb has either stolen nuclear secrets from another country or has had the cooperation of another atomic power.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thomas Reed said in an interview to the US News that in 1990 China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb during Benazir Bhutto regime.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas Reed said that he believes, based on many reasons, that China had tested Pakistan's first atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reasons include the design of that bomb and information received during conversations with Chinese scientists.</seg>
<seg id="7">He further said that this is why Pakistan was able to carry out atomic test within only two weeks and three days in response to India's atomic tests in 1998.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thomas Reed recalled that Russia had suddenly conducted an atomic test in 1961 and in response to it, it took America seventeen days to conduct a test in spite of the fact that America had that bomb for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="9">He further said that the atom bomb tested by Pakistan in May, 1998, had been made very carefully and Pakistani scientists had full confidence in it.</seg>
<seg id="10">When asked, why China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, Thomas Reed replied, it was because India was the common enemy of China and Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that there was also evidence that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan had in fact used Chinese design, and in addition, the documents that were later acquired from Libya confirm this.</seg>
<seg id="12">Responding to another question as to whether joint atomic tests are common practice, he said that America had openly conducted nuclear test in the Nevada Desert for Britain in 1990.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said that we also speculate that Israel was also provided access to the results of this test.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thomas Reed was also asked whether China's atomic proliferation program continues.</seg>
<seg id="15">At this, Thomas Reed said that since 1991China had been providing raw materials, instructions and design for the nuclear installation in the Iranian city, Isfahan.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition to this, China also provided Iran with the enrichment plant in Karaj</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that China had been providing atomic technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen through North Korea.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Tuesday, journalists and news personnel, under the umbrella of Islamabad journalists' organization RIUJ, protested and shouted slogans in front of Islamabad Press Club against the owners of media organizations and government on the dismissal of a large number of employees working in television channels and newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Addressing the protesters, C.R. Shamsi, senior member of the largest journalist organization, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, said that the politicians who were, till yesterday, protesting with us on the roads, are sitting as rulers in the parliament but they are not doing anything for the rights of journalists because of the fear of a particular group of newspaper owners</seg>
<seg id="4">He said that the newspaper owners who talk about human rights have turned their institutions into prisons and slave labor camps where despite the earnings of billions of rupees annually, workers are being paid very low wages and hundreds of them are being killed economically because of their dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="5">An example of this is in front of us as an employee of Lahore based private TV channel 5 committed suicide because he did not get his salary for four months. Even today, many employees are living in hardship because of forced expulsions and non payment of salaries for months.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that right steps should be taken against owners of TV channels and newspapers and a permanent protest camp should be put in front of the parliament for the rights of journalists.</seg>
<seg id="7">C. R. Shamsi criticized Punjab Governor, Salman Taseer, saying that employees are being dismissed from his Urdu newspaper 'Aajkal' without any notice.</seg>
<seg id="8">Whereas the Daily Jinnah, Daily Khabrain, Channel 5, Business Plus TV and AaJ TV too have dismissed dozens of employees.</seg>
<seg id="9">Addressing the protesters, Secretary General of PUFJ, Mazhar Abbas, said that journalist organizations all across the country are observing today as a black day against the dismissal of journalists and newspaper employees, while the journalists will go to the parliament session wearing black bands around their arms in order to claim their rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Mazhar Abbas, employees and journalists are being exploited in 85% of the newspapers and TV channels where they are working without ant contracts.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that so far, more than 200 journalists and employees are being dismissed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is feared that the owners will dismiss hundreds of more employees during the current year under the pretext of economic crisis.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mazhar Abbas said that the movement of journalists will continue until the dismissed employees are reinstated, the Seventh Wage Board Award specifying the wages of newspaper employees is implemented and salaries unpaid for several months of TV channels and newspaper workers are disbursed.</seg>

<seg id="4">Spokesman for the European Commission, Amadeu Altafaj, said, any such effort is commendable that will help to convey the joint message of the European Union to the warring factions.</seg>

<seg id="6">But in reality, the European Union presents a sad picture of internal conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="7">Role of the Czech Republic as President of the Union is already weak.</seg>
<seg id="8">On top of it, the internal conflicts have rendered it helpless.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the other hand, the French President is behaving as if he is still discharging his duties as the President of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although France has already completed its six month term.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he does have the ability to do that but he does not have permission to do so.</seg>

<seg id="14">On top of that, both Foreign Ministers are giving divergent statement regarding the Middle East war.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kouchner believes that Israel has the right to defend itself whereas according to Schwarzenberg this war does not fall under the category of self defense. On the other hand Germany has also dispatched its special envoy to the Middle East. Until the European Union shows cohesiveness in its stand it can never be successful at the diplomatic front.</seg>
<seg id="16">The proof for this is Israeli attitude that does not give any credence to the peace initiatives of Europe</seg>

<seg id="1">Economic Crisis: German Billionaire Industrialist Commits Suicide</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Adolf Merckle of south Germany has left behind a huge business group.</seg>
<seg id="3">But a little while ago ordinary German citizen did not know much about him.</seg>
<seg id="4">And when he had to negotiate for several weeks with nearly 30 banks that gave loans to his business group, he came into limelight and he could also see the future of Merckle Group as bleak.</seg>
<seg id="5">Merckle Group faced loss of several hundred million euros after buying shares of the German car manufacturer Volks Wagen, due to the economic crisis.</seg>
<seg id="6">After that, when financial institutions declined to lend to this Group the required loan of 700 million to 1 billion euros, Merckle came under immense pressure.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some time ago, the same banks had agreed to give loan on emergency basis to the Merckle Group, but Adolf Merckle who started as a small industrialist and rose to this position and the annual income of whose industrial group was around 30 billion euros could not bear the loss of his investment powers.</seg>
<seg id="8">When Adolf Merckle took over the family business after the death of his father, he organized it on modern principles and soon made enormous progress.</seg>
<seg id="9">He named his company Ratiopharm, which today is a highly successful and a very large drug manufacturing company in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until some time ago, the business worth of this pharmaceutical company was between 5 and 6 billion euros and it still makes an annual income of 8.1billion euros. After the tremendous success of Ratiopharm, Merckle Group acquired many large companies; ranging from the building and construction material company, Heidelberg Cement, to the special vehicles manufacturing company, Kaessbohrer.</seg>
<seg id="11">The worldwide workforce of Merckle Group is almost 100,000 persons, and Ratiopharm pharmaceutical company has always enjoyed special significance.</seg>
<seg id="12">During his life Adolf Merckle said on several occasions, "We have been making medicine for the last four generations.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now the control of this company is in the hands of my children and I hope that for the next few hundred years it will remain under the administration of my family.</seg>
<seg id="14">After Adolf Merckle's suicide, the banks have approved 400 million euros of bridge VEM loan for his group but on the condition that Ratiopharm has to be sold so that the VEM financial condition of this group can be improved over a long term.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also, after the death of Adolf Merckle the Merckle Group will not be the same as it used to be.</seg>

<seg id="1">Crime Rate among Foreigners in Germany</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">According to recent statistics, crime rate among foreigners, between 2004 and 2007,</seg>
<seg id="3">has fallen from 22 percent to 21</seg>
<seg id="4">per cent.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the Interior Minister of Bavaria province, Joachim Herrmann, this is just a superficial positive change.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said, "It should be kept in mind that the number of foreigners obtaining German citizenship is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Therefore, statistics should mention that although the one committing crime is a German citizen; his background is foreign.</seg>
<seg id="8">Herrmann said that his province will keep this in consideration while gathering statistics from 2010 onward.</seg>
<seg id="9">Apart from Bavaria, Hamburg is also thinking on these lines.</seg>
<seg id="10">Senator of Interior Affairs, Christoph Ahlhaus, from CDU said, "When research is carried out on scientific lines, one cannot make conclusions of one's choice but they depend on the statistics gathered as a result of research.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ahlhaus drew attention to an analytical report of the provincial office on the prevention of crimes which had been prepared in July, 2006 and which ascertained the rate of crimes among foreigners in Bergdorf area of Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="12">Results suggested that the crime rate among the foreigners here</seg>
<seg id="13">was lower than that of crimes committed in all other areas of the province.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the contrary, when the youth crime rate in Berlin during 2006 was analyzed, it became obvious that the rate of crimes in youths with foreign background</seg>
<seg id="15">was 44 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, Germany's other political parties such as SPD, the party of environmentalists and leftwing party Linkspartei are against the proposalthat data should be collected about foreign background of German citizens in the crime related statistics.</seg>

</hl>
<seg id="2">In this 30-minute long video, a masked person wearing a black turban and holding a gun is delivering a message to the German government.</seg>
<seg id="3">This person introduces himself as Abu Talha and is speaking in German language.</seg>
<seg id="4">The video message has Arabic subtitles as well.</seg>
<seg id="5">Al-Qaeda logo is displayed the side of the screen and the date October 2008, shows in the video.</seg>
<seg id="6">This message says to the German government that the deployment of such a large number of troops in Afghanistan indicates that this country believes it will not be attacked-this is nothing but foolishness.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although this person, who called himself Abu Talha, did not threaten direct attacks on Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently, the number of German soldiers in Afghanistan, in NATO's coalition army, is 3,500.</seg>
<seg id="9">In October last year, German parliament gave the legal authorization for deployment of an additional 1000 soldiers to Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the first message from Al-Qaeda, received by Germany.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mikhail LUEDERS, an renowned expert on terrorist affairs, said regarding this message: "The recent suicide attack outside the German Embassy in Kabul is proof that we must take it seriously in every way.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the last few years, Al-Qaeda has been posting video messages on the internet, and such messages have also been followed by attacks.</seg>
<seg id="13">Militant organization, Taliban, assumed responsibility for the suicide attack outside the German Embassy in Kabul on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Most German newspapers and analysts are seeing this attack linked to the Al-Qaeda message.</seg>
<seg id="15">They are targeting Germany."</seg>
<seg id="16">Fundamentalist Muslims see Germany's Afghan policy with a negative and critical view.</seg>
<seg id="17">They allege German government for adopting a biased policy not only towards Afghanistan but for the Middle East as well.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is the reason why they are considering Germany, more and more as their target.</seg>
<seg id="19">Meanwhile, German government has said that German intelligence had information about this video even before it became public.</seg>
<seg id="20">German federal department of crime prevention is busy investigating the video message.</seg>

<seg id="3">India has persistently been holding active militant and non-militant groups in Pakistan responsible.</seg>

<seg id="5">Whereas the Indian security agencies have held Lashkar-e-Taiba directly responsible for the Mumbai attacks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The name of Jama'at-ud-Da'wah has also surfaced time and again in this connection.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is not the first time that the relations between the two countries have suffered on account of some act of terrorism in India.</seg>
<seg id="8">In December 2001, these two neighboring countries reached on the brink of war after an attack on the Indian parliament.</seg>
<seg id="9">After this, in 2002, Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned and included in the list of the terrorist groups.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, it is being demanded that Jama'at-ud-Da'wah which the security analysts say is actually the new face of Lashkar-e-Taiba should be banned.</seg>
<seg id="11">Should this group, in your opinion, be banned or not?</seg>

<seg id="1">Most of the elders of my family belonged to labor class</seg>
<seg id="2">and when in my childhood I used to watch my paternal and maternal uncles doing menial labor, I used to pray to God to spare me from such physical hardship.</seg>
<seg id="3">To avoid this, I wrote a letter to the editor of Daily Imroz and asked him what I should do after matriculation so that I did not have to do hard labor.</seg>
<seg id="4">The editor replied that I should become doctor or engineer and start studying the respective subjects.</seg>
<seg id="5">From the beginning, I was inclined towards engineering and in the matriculation I had studied Technical Drawing instead of Biology.</seg>
<seg id="6">But at the time of admission in F.Sc., my elder brother forced me to do F.Sc. in pre-medical and become a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="7">I studied Biology hardly for one month and when I could not understand a word of it, I exchanged it for Mathematics.</seg>
<seg id="8">I mean the fear of menial labor made an engineer of me and now I am at a very good position among many of my peers and am always thankful to God for this blessing.</seg>
<seg id="9">I was reminded of this when I was trying to lift the carpets from my old home with the help of my two young sons.</seg>
<seg id="10">We were not even half an hour into the work when the younger son said, "Dad, I think I was not born to do this work".</seg>

<seg id="12">The son said that he was studying and would complete his studies but he could not do that kind of work.</seg>
<seg id="13">Somehow, the three of us completed that work in three hours and returned home.</seg>

<seg id="1">The conditions are steadily getting worse in the troubled areas of Swat in the Frontier province despite the military operation that has been going on for more than a year.</seg>
<seg id="2">On the one hand, the government's writ in this area has been reduced to passage of a resolution of condemnation in the National Assembly and on the other hand the influence of the illegal FM radio channel of the Taliban has been steadily increasing in Swat.</seg>
<seg id="3">The third aspect is that the ordinary citizen finds it convenient to obey the person who is ruling the area.</seg>
<seg id="4">The claims are made about the deaths of many extremists in Swat by the gunship helicopters and in the artillery fire in the operation being conducted by the security forces. But despite these deaths, not only have the Taliban consolidated even further but according to one estimate, their control has spread to almost eighty percent of Swat.</seg>
<seg id="5">Consequently, on the one hand the government is not prepared to concede its failure and on the other hand, the Taliban are more stable.</seg>
<seg id="6">And who has been crushed between the two: the ordinary citizens.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is said in Swat now that someone asked what kind of people Taliban were and the reply came that they were very good since they were the guardians of the faith and were fighting the 'enemies of God and religion'.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then they were asked about the army and the reply was that the army was good because it 'guarded the country and fought against the enemies of the state'.</seg>

<seg id="2">They had been expressing this displeasure everyday by blowing up schools and colleges for women at one place or the other.</seg>

<seg id="5">Actually, the girls' schools were first destroyed following the famous English proverb "ladies first". It is beyond reason why people are still bent upon calling Taliban as uncivilized and wild people ignorant of civilization.</seg>

<seg id="1">Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has once again accused that Pakistan is trying to incite the atmosphere of war.</seg>
<seg id="2">And Pakistan uses terrorism as state policy.</seg>
<seg id="3">Addressing the conference of the Chief Ministers in New Delhi, Manmohan Singh said that the terrorist elements are backed by the neighboring countries, particularly by Pakistan</seg>
<seg id="4">and the terrorists involved in Mumbai attacks used naval route and remained safe from the Indian coastguards.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indian Prime Minister said that the Mumbai attacks of November were carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba.</seg>
<seg id="6">He further said that the terrorists were using new techniques and the latest communication systems. They should increase the intensity at the Line of Control from where incursions take place. He said that terrorism would not be tolerated in any form and that was their policy.</seg>
